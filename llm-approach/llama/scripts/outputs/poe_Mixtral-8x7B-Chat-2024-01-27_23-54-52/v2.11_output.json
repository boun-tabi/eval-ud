Affirmative is the opposite of negative in English (e.g. \"I am\" vs. \"I am not\"), but positive has a different meaning in formal linguistics, namely that the statement doesn't raise any doubt about its own truth value, as opposed to interrogative or rhetorical sentences.\n\nThe \"form of verb or deverbative is verbal noun\" means that the verb \"tut\" is in the form of a nominalized verb, or gerund.\n\nYou are right about the case of \"zeminde\".\nUser 1: Thank you so much! I'm going to remember this distinction between \"positive\" and \"affirmative\" (and I'm going to try to find out what \"form of verb or deverbative is verbal noun\" means!)\nUser 0: You're welcome. \n\nA verbal noun is a word that is formed from a verb but functions as a noun. In English, the verbal noun of \"to read\" is \"reading\". In Turkish, the verbal noun of \"oku\" is \"okuma\". The verbal noun of \"tut\" is \"tutma\". \n\nAll verbal nouns are nouns, but not all nouns are verbal nouns. For instance, \"okuma\" is a noun, but \"okul\" (school) is not a verbal noun.\nUser 1: Thank you! I thought that's what it meant, but I wasn't sure. I've never heard the term \"deverbative\" before, so I didn't know how to interpret it.\n\n[This Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deverbative) explains that a deverbative is \"a word that is derived from a verb but is not a verb itself\".\n\nSo I think that in this case, it means that \"tut\" is a verb, but \"tutma\" is a deverbative noun.\nUser 0: That's correct. \"Tutma\" is a deverbative noun, but because of the specific morphological context, it is formed from the verb \"tut\".\n\n(There are also deverbal adjectives, for instance, \"tutan\" (holding))\nUser 1: Thank you, this has been very helpful!

The empty strings are probably used to denote the end of the sentence (because the beginning is typically marked by a <s> tag).\n\nI agree with you that it's probably best to just ignore the empty strings (except for the beginning and end of sentence markers) since they don't contribute to the actual meaning of the sentence.\nUser 0: Yes, you are correct.
