        "output": "To reconstruct the surface form of the sentence from the given lemmas and their grammatical information, we need to carefully adjust for Irish syntax, morphology, and orthographic conventions such as lenition and eclipsis.\n\n1. **bí** - Since it's a lenited past tense verb, it should appear as \"bhí\".\n2. **coicís** - Singular noun, remains \"coicís\".\n3. **i** - Adposition, remains \"i\".\n4. **anois** - Adverb, remains \"anois\".\n5. **ó** - Adposition, remains \"ó\".\n6. **tar** - Lenited past tense verb, should be \"thar\".\n7. **siad** - Pronoun, remains \"siad\".\n8. **,**\n9. **agus** - Coordinating conjunction, remains \"agus\".\n10. **dá** - Subordinating conjunction, remains \"dá\".\n11. **fad** - Lenited masculine singular noun, becomes \"fhad\".\n12. **dá** - Particle, remains \"dá\".\n13. **bí** - Eclipsed conditional plural verb, becomes \"mbíodh\".\n14. **i** - Adposition, remains \"i\".\n15. **is** - Copula, remains \"is\".\n16. **ea** - Pronoun, remains \"ea\".\n17. **is** - Superlative particle, remains \"is\".\n18. **contúirteach** - Comparative/superlative adjective, remains \"contúirteach\".\n19. **do** - Adposition, remains \"do\".\n20. **é** - Pronoun, remains \"é\".\n21. **.**\n\nCombining all these elements, the surface form of the sentence in Irish would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Bhí coicís i anois ó thar siad, agus dá fhad dá mbíodh i is ea is contúirteach do é.\"}\n```\n\nNote: The construction around tokens 10 to 13, involving \"dá fhad dá mbíodh\", might seem unusual as it involves complex subordination and conditional forms. The use of \"dá\" as both a subordinating conjunction and a relative particle in proximity can be context-dependent in Irish, and without more context, this reconstruction assumes typical grammatical structures."

It translates to \"we welcome\" in English.\n2. **Adpositions and Nouns**: The adposition \"roimh\" governs \"tairiscint,\" which is in the accusative-nominative case and is modified by \"ábhar\" in the genitive plural. This forms the phrase \"roimh ábhair tairiscintí,\" translating as \"before proposals of subjects.\"\n3. **Particle and Infinitive**: The particle \"a\" marks the infinitive and is followed by \"deonú,\" meaning \"to grant.\"\n4. **Prepositional Pronoun**: \"ar\" typically stands for \"on us\" or \"for us,\" reflecting the 1st person plural.\n5. **Complex Prepositions and Nouns**: \"de réir\" is a prepositional phrase meaning \"according to,\" which governs \"gnáthchritéar.\" The noun \"gnáthchritéar\" is modified by \"roghnúchán\" in the genitive singular, forming the phrase \"de réir gnáthchritéar roghnúcháin,\" translating as \"according to the normal criteria of selection.\"\n6. **Punctuation**: The sentence ends with a period.\n\nCombining all, the sentence in Irish would likely be:\n\n\"Fáiltímid roimh ábhair tairiscintí a dheonú orainn de réir gnáthchritéar roghnúcháin.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON representation of the original form of the sentence is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Fáiltímid roimh ábhair tairiscintí a dheonú orainn de réir gnáthchritéar roghnúcháin.\"}\n```"

In Irish, the copula \"is\" is used to link the subject and predicate in a descriptive clause and often starts the sentence.\n2. **\"furasta\"**: An adjective in its positive form. This is the root of the sentence and serves as the predicate adjective.\n3. **\"aithne\"**: A noun in the nominative/accusative case, feminine and singular. This noun acts as the subject of the sentence.\n4. **\"é\"**: A pronoun indicating masculine, singular, third person. This pronoun modifies the noun \"aithne,\" and in Irish, pronouns typically follow the noun they modify.\n5. **\".\"**: Punctuation indicating the end of the sentence.\n\nGiven the dependencies and the typical structure of Irish sentences involving a copula, the sentence likely reads:\n\n**\"Is furasta aithne é.\"**\n\nThis sentence translates to \"It is easy to recognize him.\" Here, \"aithne\" is the subject, made definite and described by the pronoun \"é,\" and \"furasta\" is the predicate linked by the copula \"is.\"\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Is furasta aithne é.\"}\n```"
