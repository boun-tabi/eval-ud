It has 2 tokens. Please include all the tokens in your answer in order.\n\n1st token's lemma is \"yüzük\", its part of speech is adjective, its case is nominative, its number is singular number, its person is third person, and it depends on the 2nd token with the relation of possessive nominal modifier.\n2nd token's lemma is \"metot\", its part of speech is noun, its case is nominative, its number is singular number, its possessor’s number is singular possessor, its person is third person, its person of possessor is third person, and it's the root token.\n\nAnswer in JSON, in the following format:\n\n{\"original_form\": <SENTENCE>}",
        "output": "{\"original\\_form\": \"metotun yüzükleri\"}\n\nIn this example, the surface form of the sentence would be \"metotun yüzükleri\", which is constructed by combining the lemma \"metot\" with the possessive nominal modifier \"yüzük\" that has the third person singular possessor. The resulting word \"metotun\" means \"its method\" or \"the method of it\", and the word \"yüzük\" is a plural noun meaning \"rings\" in this context. The final sentence \"metotun yüzükleri\" means \"its method rings\" or \"the method of its rings\". The word \"yüzük\" is in the nominative case, singular number, and third person. The word \"metot\" is in the nominative case, singular number, and third person, with a singular possessor. The order of the words in Turkish is determined by the grammatical structure of the sentence, and the word order in this example is determined by the possessive relationship between the two words. In this case, the possessor \"metot\" is placed before the possessed \"yüzükleri\" in the sentence. The final token is the punctuation mark \".\", which is not included in the given linguistic features. However, it is included in the answer to show the complete sentence. The token \"yüzük\" is an adjective in the given linguistic features, but it is used as a noun in this context, and this is reflected in the surface form.
