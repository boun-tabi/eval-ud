It has 2 tokens. Please include all the tokens in your answer in order.\n\n1st token's lemma is \"yüzük\", its part of speech is adjective, its case is nominative, its number is singular number, its person is third person, and it depends on the 2nd token with the relation of possessive nominal modifier.\n2nd token's lemma is \"metot\", its part of speech is noun, its case is nominative, its number is singular number, its possessor’s number is singular possessor, its person is third person, its person of possessor is third person, and it's the root token.\n\nAnswer in JSON, in the following format:\n\n{\"original_form\": <SENTENCE>}",
        "output": "{\"original\\_form\": \"metotun yüzükleri\"}\n\nIn this example, the surface form of the sentence would be \"metotun yüzükleri\", which is constructed by combining the lemma \"metot\" with the possessive nominal modifier \"yüzük\" that has the third person singular possessor. The resulting word \"metotun\" means \"its method\" or \"the method of it\", and the word \"yüzük\" is a plural noun meaning \"rings\" in this context. The final sentence \"metotun yüzükleri\" means \"its method rings\" or \"the method of its rings\". The word \"yüzük\" is in the nominative case, singular number, and third person. The word \"metot\" is in the nominative case, singular number, and third person, with a singular possessor. The order of the words in Turkish is determined by the grammatical structure of the sentence, and the word order in this example is determined by the possessive relationship between the two words. In this case, the possessor \"metot\" is placed before the possessed \"yüzükleri\" in the sentence. The final token is the punctuation mark \".\", which is not included in the given linguistic features. However, it is included in the answer to show the complete sentence. The token \"yüzük\" is an adjective in the given linguistic features, but it is used as a noun in this context, and this is reflected in the surface form.

The root token is \"çık\" (noun), but it's more likely that it's intended to be the verb \"çıkmak\" (to exit, to leave).\n2. The 1st token \"Komintern\" is a proper noun in the nominative case, and it depends on the 2nd token with the relation of possessive nominal modifier. The surface form would be \"Komintern'in\" (Komintern's).\n3. The 2nd token \"belge\" is a noun in the accusative case, and it depends on the 3rd token with the relation of direct object. The surface form would be \"belgelerini\" (its documents).\n4. The 3rd token \"çık\" is a verb with the lemma \"çıkmak\" (to exit, to leave). Since it is the root token, we can assume it is in the imperative form. The surface form would be \"çıktı\" (go out).\n5. The 4th token \"koy\" is a verb with the lemma \"koymak\" (to put, to place). It has the aspect of perfect aspect, evidentiality of first hand, and it depends on the 3rd token with the relation of conjunct. The surface form would be \"koyduk\" (we put).\n6. The 5th token \".\" is a punctuation mark, and it depends on the 4th token with the relation of punctuation. The surface form would be \".\" (period).\n\nSo, the final surface form of the sentence is \"Komintern'in belgelerini çıktık.\" (We took out Komintern's documents)."
