Below is the analysis and assembly of these tokens into a coherent Turkish sentence:\n\n- **1st token \"hafifçe\"** (adverb): Modifies the verb, usually preceding it.\n- **2nd token \"renk\"** (noun): Subject of the verb, turns into \"renklenmiş\" (participle form, past tense).\n- **3rd token \"dön\"** (verb): Forms a participle modifying \"renk\", hence \"renklenmiş\".\n- **4th token \"patlıcan\"** (noun): Direct object in plural form with accusative case, hence \"patlıcanları\".\n- **5th token \"tepsi\"** (noun): Dative case, \"tepsiye\".\n- **6th token \"yay\"** (verb): Main verb of the clause including \"renklenmiş patlıcanları\" and \"tepsiye\", \"yayıldı\" (past tense).\n- **7th token \"tuz\"** (verb): Root verb, instrumental case would be unusual for a verb; likely a noun here, \"tuzla\".\n- **8th token \"Üzer\"** (noun): Dative case again, suggests a locative relationship, \"üzerine\".\n- **9th token \"hazırla\"** (verb): Forms a participle modifying \"köfte\", hence \"hazırlanmış\".\n- **10th token \"köfte\"** (noun): Direct object in plural accusative, \"köfteleri\".\n- **11th token \"diz\"** (verb): Likely a verb here, combining with \"tuzla\" in a construction, \"dizdi\".\n- **12th token \".\"** (punctuation): Sentence end.\n\nThe sentence is likely meant to describe a sequence where vegetables (eggplants) are spread out, seasoned, and prepared in a dish context. Here's how it might be assembled:\n\n\"Hafifçe renklenmiş patlıcanları tepsinin üzerine yaydım, tuzla hazırlanmış köfteleri dizdim.\"\n\nThis sentence translates to English as: \"I gently spread the slightly colored eggplants onto the tray, and arranged the salt-prepared meatballs.\""

As it depends on \"geri\" and forms a compound with it, the correct form should be \"geri dönüş\" (return or turning back), where \"dönüş\" is the noun form of \"dön.\"\n4. **karar** - This word is a verb in the past tense, first-person plural, causative voice. The correct verb form would be \"karar verdik\" (we decided). Given that it handles a causative construction, it indicates a decision made by us.\n5. **.** - This is simply the punctuation marking the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence likely reads:\n\n**\"Ahmet'in geri dönüşüne karar verdik.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"We decided on Ahmet's return.\"\n\nThe JSON format for this sentence is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Ahmet'in geri dönüşüne karar verdik.\"}\n```"

        "output": "Based on the analysis of the provided sentence structure and morphological features, let's reconstruct the sentence:\n\n1. \"Zaten\" is an adverb modifying the main verb of the sentence, functioning as an adverbial modifier.\n2. The second and third tokens, \"ol\" (conditional verb) and \"y\" (auxiliary verb indicating past tense, perfect aspect, first-hand evidentiality), create a complex verb form. In Turkish, the combination \"olsaydım\" translates to \"if I had been\" or \"if I were\".\n3. \"Bu\" functions as a determiner for the noun \"gün\".\n4. \"Gün\" is a noun in the dative case, plural form; however, due to the presence of the emphasizing word \"de\" attached to it, the correct form should be \"bu güne de\" (to this day too/also on this day).\n5. The seventh and eighth tokens, \"gel\" and \"y\", form a verb phrase. \"Gel\" is a verb in a potential mood, negative, habitual aspect, and functioning as a participle, while \"y\" is an auxiliary verb indicating past tense and first-hand evidentiality. In Turkish, this combination translates to \"gelmezdim\" (I would not usually come).\n6. The final token is the punctuation mark \".\".\n\nCombining these elements, the surface form of the sentence in Turkish would be:\n\n**\"Zaten olsaydım bu güne de gelmezdim.\"**\n\nThus, the JSON format of the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Zaten olsaydım bu güne de gelmezdim.\"}\n```"

In Turkish, the dative case is typically marked by the suffix \"-e\" or \"-a\" depending on vowel harmony. Since \"İstanbul\" ends with a vowel, the dative case would likely be \"-a\".\n2. **taşı** - This is a verb in its participle form and reflexive voice. Since it's a participle, it functions similar to an adjective or adverb describing the noun or action.\n3. **y** - This is an auxiliary verb indicating evidentiality (first hand), in the past tense and first person plural. The lemma \"y\" surfaces as \"i\" when conjugated in this context.\n4. **.** - Punctuation.\n\nCombining the tokens:\n- \"İstanbul\" in the dative case becomes \"İstanbul’a\".\n- The participle form of \"taşı\" combined with the evidential and tense marking from \"y\" could be rendered as \"taşınmışız\" (reflexive voice with the meaning \"we have been moved/carried\" and indicating a firsthand evidentiality of past action).\n\nThus, the sentence could be constructed as:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"İstanbul’a taşınmışız.\"}\n```"

Here is the analysis for each token:\n\n1. **Ekmek** - Noun, accusative case, singular number, third person; should be in the accusative form, likely \"ekmeği\".\n2. **Deniz** - Noun, ablative case, singular number, third person; the ablative form is \"denizden\".\n3. **Çık** - Verb, participle, habitual aspect, positive affirmation; functions as part of the main verb phrase.\n4. **Y** - Auxiliary verb, first-hand evidentiality, past tense, singular number, third person; combines with the previous verb to form \"çıkmış\".\n5. **Bu** - Determiner, modifies a noun.\n6. **Deniz** - Noun, nominative case, singular number, third person; as a possessive modifier, likely \"denizin\".\n7. **İnsan** - Noun, nominative case, plural number, with a singular possessor, third person; combined with the previous token to form \"bu denizin insanları\".\n8. **.** - Punctuation, marks the end of the sentence.\n\nCombining the analysis:\n\n- \"Ekmek\" (bread) is the direct object in the accusative case, so \"ekmeği\".\n- \"Deniz\" (sea) in the ablative case reflects the origin or separation, so \"denizden\".\n- \"Çık\" and \"y\" combine to form \"çıkmış\", indicating a past habitual action observed first-hand.\n- \"Bu\" (this) is a determiner referring to \"deniz\" (sea) which is modified to \"denizin\" as a possessive form.\n- \"İnsan\" (people) in the nominative plural with a singular possessor forms \"insanları\" (people of).\n\nThus, the sentence in its correct form would be:\n\n**\"Denizden ekmek çıkmış bu denizin insanları.\"**\n\nThis sentence translates to \"The people of this sea have habitually produced bread.\"\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Denizden ekmek çıkmış bu denizin insanları.\"}\n```"

        "output": "Based on the detailed linguistic analysis provided for each token in the Turkish sentence, the surface form can be determined by appropriately morphing and arranging the lemmas according to Turkish grammar and syntax. Here is the analysis for reconstructing the sentence:\n\n1. The first token \"iki\" is a numeral meaning \"two\" and modifies the second token \"veli\".\n2. The second token \"veli\" is a noun in the nominative case and pluralized due to the numeric modifier \"iki\", becoming \"veliler\" in Turkish (plural form of \"veli\").\n3. The third token \"dokun\" is a verb in the desiderative mood and passive voice. In Turkish, passive voice can be indicated by certain morphological changes; however, the base form \"dokun\" suggests \"touched\" or \"to be touched\".\n4. and 5. The fourth token \"ağla\" and fifth token \"y\" combine to form the verb phrase \"ağlamış\", which translates to \"has cried\" in English. \"Ağla\" is a participle with prospective aspect, and \"y\" is an auxiliary verb indicating perfect aspect, past tense, and first-hand evidentiality.\n5. The sixth token is a punctuation mark \".\".\n\nThus, assembling all these elements considering Turkish syntax and morphology, the sentence reads:\n\n**\"İki veliye dokunulmuş.\"**\n\nHere, \"İki veli\" has been pluralized to \"veliye\" in the dative case because the verb \"dokunmak\" (to touch) typically requires the dative case for its object in Turkish. The desiderative and passive voice of \"dokun\" has been expressed as \"dokunulmuş,\" indicating something like \"has been touched.\"\n\nPutting this into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"İki veliye dokunulmuş.\"}\n```"

        "output": "Based on the analysis of the tokens given in the test example, it appears there is an error in the provided token details. The lemma for the 4th token is indicated as \"çevrili,\" which is actually a verb meaning \"is surrounded\" and not punctuation as mistakenly labeled. Assuming the correct part of speech for the 4th token and considering Turkish grammar rules, I will construct the sentence accordingly.\n\n1. The quotes before and after the sentence are represented by the 1st and 5th tokens, both of which are punctuation marks.\n2. The 2nd token, \"füze,\" is a noun in its plural form. The correct surface form should be \"füzeler,\" which is the plural form of \"füze\" in nominative case.\n3. The 3rd token, \"ABD,\" is a proper noun in dative case, indicating \"to the USA\" or \"toward the USA,\" correctly surfaced as \"ABD'ye.\"\n4. The 4th token, as corrected, would be \"çevrili,\" a passive form of a verb indicating \"is surrounded.\"\n\nThus, the sentence structured with correct forms and according to Turkish grammar and syntax would be:\n\n\"Füzeler ABD'ye çevrili.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON formatted original form of the sentence, including the punctuation, is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"\\\"Füzeler ABD'ye çevrili.\\\"\"}\n```"

        "output": "The sentence described through the given linguistic features can be constructed as follows:\n\n- The 1st token \"kardeş\" is a noun in genitive case, which typically attaches a possessive suffix. Because it's singular and third person (his/her brother's), it takes the form \"kardeşin\".\n- The 2nd token \"kardeş\" is another noun in accusative case, indicating a direct object. It is singular, third person, and has a singular possessor, which would typically be reflected in Turkish by adding a possessive suffix (his/her brother). This results in \"kardeşi\".\n- The 3rd token \"öl\" is a causative verb, which is in the past tense, perfect aspect, and participle form. Since this verb is causing an action, it's often rendered in Turkish as \"öldür\" (to cause to die) but in this context, being a participle modifying a noun, it should be \"öldürülen\" (the one who was caused to die).\n- The 4th token \"cinayet\" is a noun in nominative case and plural number, which translates simply to \"cinayetler\" (murders).\n- The 5th token is a punctuation mark, a period \".\".\n\nConcatenating these forms with appropriate Turkish syntax gives:\n\n**\"Kardeşin kardeşi öldürülen cinayetler.\"**\n\nThis can be interpreted as \"The murders where his/her brother was the one killed.\"\n\nHence, the JSON output for the original form of the sentence should be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Kardeşin kardeşi öldürülen cinayetler.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To form the surface structure of the sentence, we need to correctly apply morphological and syntactic rules of Turkish to the lemmas and their features described. Turkish is an agglutinative language, meaning that the morphemes that encode grammatical relationships are often attached to the base of the words in the form of suffixes. Also, Turkish generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. Let's analyze and build the sentence from the given lemmas and features:\n\n1. `\"\"` - Start of the quotation.\n2. `zavallı` - Adjective modifying `ölümlü`.\n3. `ölümlü` - Noun, plural (`-ler` for nominative plural).\n4. `-` - Punctuation, hyphen separating elements.\n5. `kendi` - Reflexive pronoun, in accusative plural which generally doesn't change the form but context may affect this.\n6. `iş` - Noun, dative plural (`işlere`).\n7. `kapanmıştı` - Verb, formed by combining `kap` (root) + `an` (participle marker) + `mış` (past evidential) + `tı` (past copula).\n8. `ölüm` - Noun, plural nominative (`ölümler`).\n9. `-` - Punctuation, hyphen.\n10. `en` - Adverb modifying `güzel`.\n11. `güzel` - Adjective.\n12. `gün` - Noun, genitive plural (`günlerin`).\n13. `,` - Punctuation, comma.\n14. `ilk` - Adverb.\n15. `önce` - Adverb.\n16. `geçip` - Verb, converb form of `geç`, indicating action done prior to another (`geç` + `ip`).\n17. `gitmiş` - Verb, participle form of `git` (`git` + `miş`).\n18. `günler` - Noun, plural nominative.\n19. `olmuştu` - Verb in past perfect tense (`ol` + `muş` + `tu`).\n20. `kuşkusu` - Noun in accusative singular (`kuşku` + `su`).\n21. `duyuluyor` - Verb, passive voice in present habitual aspect (`duy` + `ul` + `uyor`).\n22. `mu` - Discourse particle indicating a question.\n23. `?` - Punctuation, question mark.\n\n### Combining and rearranging for correct syntax and morphology:\n```\n\"Zavallı ölümler - kendi işlerine kapanmıştı - ölümler en güzel günlerin, ilk önce geçip gitmiş günler olmuştu kuşkusu duyuluyor mu?\"\n```\n\nThis sentence translates all the rules and dependencies into a coherent Turkish sentence framed as a question. Let's put this in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Zavallı ölümler - kendi işlerine kapanmıştı - ölümler en güzel günlerin, ilk önce geçip gitmiş günler olmuştu kuşkusu duyuluyor mu?\"\n}\n```"

Here’s how we process each token:\n\n1. **Yatırım** - It's a noun in the accusative case. The accusative case for singular nouns typically ends with \"-i\" (depending on vowel harmony). Thus, \"yatırım\" becomes \"yatırımı\".\n   \n2. **Bolu** - It's a proper noun in the dative case. The typical suffix for dative in Turkish is \"-e\" or \"-a\" depending on vowel harmony. For \"Bolu,\" it should be \"Bolu'ya\".\n   \n3. **Kay** - It's a causative verb in the past tense, perfect aspect, affirmative, and evidentiality is first-hand. The verb \"kay\" (which doesn't directly correspond to a common Turkish verb but may be a form of \"kaydetmek\" or another similar verb and is likely shortened or transformed for this exercise) would take the past tense suffix \"-dı\" (considering vowel harmony with \"a\"), and the causative suffix \"-dır\".

Since \"Brezilya\" ends with \"a\", the locative form would be \"Brezilya'da\".\n\n2. **isyan** (Lemma: \"isyan\", Noun, Nominative case): As a singular noun in the nominative case, \"isyan\" remains unchanged.\n\n3. **din** (Lemma: \"din\", Verb, Past tense, Perfect aspect, First hand evidentiality, Positive, Third person singular): The past tense of \"din\" in Turkish is \"dindi\". Considering it as a first-hand evidential, the suffix \"-miş\" is typically used to indicate this evidentiality, forming \"dindi\" (since the past tense information is already included and assuming the lemma already implies the complete form).\n\nTherefore, combining these tokens with appropriate Turkish syntax, the sentence would be:\n\n**\"Brezilya'da isyan dindi.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"The rebellion calmed down in Brazil.\" in English, assuming \"din\" in this context means to calm down or cease, rather than \"listen\".\n\nThus, the JSON output would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Brezilya'da isyan dindi.\"}\n```"

The 1st token \"vur\" is a verb used as a verbal noun (nominal form), which in this context translates into its noun form, typically as \"vuruş\" in Turkish. Given the dependency relation of possessive nominal modifier, the form should consider the possessive suffix for \"singular possessor\", resulting in \"vuruşu\" for \"his/her/its strike\".\n2. The 2nd token \"yanlış\" is a noun in the accusative case and plural form. Since it is owned by the \"vuruşu\", it should have the third person singular possessive suffix, yielding \"yanlışları\" for \"his/her/its mistakes\".\n3. The 3rd token \"yap\" is a verb in the past tense, first person plural, perfect aspect, and affirmative. This is translated as \"yaptık\", meaning \"we did\".\n4.

        "output": "The surface form of the sentence can be constructed by considering how Turkish grammar applies to the given lemmas, parts of speech, and dependency relations. Here, we need to ensure that the morphological features such as case, number, and person along with tense, aspect, and mood are properly reflected in the final sentence. Additionally, Turkish has specific rules for verb conjugation and noun-adjective agreement which must be reflected.\n\nHere's the sentence construction:\n\n1. **belki** - \"Maybe\"\n2. **yüzyıl yaşayan biri** - \"someone who has lived a century\"\n3. **daha çok soluk alıp verdiği zor kalmış** - \"has struggled to breathe more\"\n4. **;** - \";\"\n5. **Dünya'nın havası yetersizdi** - \"the world’s air was insufficient,\"\n6. **tüm dünyanın havasına kavuştuğunda astım dinler** - \"when it reaches the air of the whole world, asthma calms down,\"\n7. **ruha dinginlik kavuşur.** - \"the soul finds tranquility.\"\n\nPutting it together, considering Turkish syntax and morphology, we get:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Belki yüzyıl yaşayan biri daha çok soluk alıp verdiği zor kalmış; Dünya'nın havası yetersizdi, tüm dünyanın havasına kavuştuğunda astım dinler, ruha dinginlik kavuşur.\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: This reconstruction aligns with the dependencies and morphological features given, though some nuances in Turkish syntactic structure might require slight adjustments. The verbs are matched to their subjects and objects accordingly, and the sentence structure considers Turkish's flexible but still rule-bound word order."

It acts as an adjectival modifier for the third token.\n3. The third token's lemma is \"kuşüzü\", which is a noun in the nominative case and singular number, possessing a third-person singular possessor.\n\nThe tricky part is handling the possessive construction. In Turkish, possession is shown by suffixation on the possessed noun. The lemma \"kuşüzü\" seems to be a typographical error or confusion as \"kuşüz\" is not a standard Turkish noun. If we correct this to a more probable word like \"kuş yuvası\" (bird's nest), the surface form would be \"yarım bardak kuş yuvası\" (half a glass of bird's nest). However, given the lemma provided, we will proceed with \"kuşüzü,\" treating it as a noun that might mean \"bird's nest\" or similar in a dialect or less common usage.\n\nThus, considering the possessive suffix \"-i\" for third person singular possessor, the construction would be:\n- \"yarım bardak kuşüzü\" (half a glass of bird's nest)\n\nSince \"bardak\" (glass) is described as modifying \"kuşüzü\", it implies that \"bardak\" specifies what \"kuşüzü\" quantifies or describes.\n\nHere is the final surface form based on the given lemmas and their grammatical relationships:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"yarım bardak kuşüzü\"}\n```"

The first token \"badem\" is described as a noun in nominative case, singular number, third person, and is said to depend on the second token as an adjectival modifier. This suggests that \"badem\" should be modifying the second token, typically functioning like an adjective.\n  \n2. The second token \"elma\" is described as a verb, which seems unusual because \"elma\" typically means \"apple\" in Turkish, a noun. However, if we interpret \"elma\" as the root of the sentence and a verb form, it might suggest a rare or poetic usage or a typographical error in the description.\n\nGiven the potential error but adhering strictly to the information provided, interpreting \"badem\" (almond) as an adjectival modifier to \"elma\" treated as a verb form, the sentence construction becomes somewhat non-standard. A possible interpretation, assuming a typographical error in the description, could be:\n\n- \"Badem elma.\" (Taking \"elma\" as a noun rather than a verb, which would translate as \"Almond apple.\" in a nominative and juxtaposition form).\n\nGiven the constraints and the unusual description, here is a potential answer in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Badem elma.\"}\n``` \n\nThis assumes a noun-noun modification or juxtaposition, which is grammatically plausible in Turkish but semantically unusual."

        "output": "To derive the surface form of the Turkish sentence given the lemmas and grammatical features, we need to apply the correct morphological changes and ensure appropriate agreement between the tokens:\n\n1. **First Token**: The lemma \"oluş\" (to form, to occur) is a verb in participle form, modifying the noun that follows. In Turkish, participles behave like adjectives, so \"oluş\" should be in an agreeing form with \"kabarcık\". The plural form of the participle should be used, resulting in \"oluşan\" (forming, occurring).\n\n2. **Second Token**: \"kabarcık\" (bubble) is a noun in plural form. Thus, it should be \"kabarcıklar\" (bubbles).\n\n3. **Third Token**: \"patla\" (burst, explode) is a verb in passive, negative, present tense, habitual aspect. In Turkish, the root \"patla\" in passive voice would typically be \"patlat-\" for active causative, but in passive form, it should be adjusted for habitual negative, which uses \"mez\". Thus, the verb form should be \"patlamaz\" (does not burst repeatedly).\n\n4. **Fourth Token**: The punctuation token \".\" remains unchanged.\n\nCombining these:\n\n- \"oluşan kabarcıklar patlamaz.\"\n\nThus, the surface form of the sentence in JSON format would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"oluşan kabarcıklar patlamaz.\"}\n```"

Here's the construct:\n\n1. **Sevgi**: As a noun in genitive case, plural number, and third person, it would typically surface as \"sevgiler\".\n2. **Yaşa**: Presented as a participle verb in past tense, dative case, singular number, and third-person possessor, this would surface as \"yaşanan\" to fit into the participle form with a dative suffix, indicating an experience of something.\n3. **Tanıklık**: As a singular, nominative noun in third person, it remains \"tanıklık\".\n4. **Et**: This verb in past tense, perfect aspect, plural number, and first-hand evidentiality, translates to \"etti\" when combined with \"tanıklık\" to form a compound (compound verb structure), giving a sense of having witnessed.\n5. **.**: Remains as punctuation.\n\nThe sentence likely reads: \"Sevgiler yaşanan tanıklık etti.\"\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Sevgiler yaşanan tanıklık etti.\"}\n```"
