The first token's lemma \"Brezilya\" is a proper noun in the locative case. Turkish uses the suffix \"-da\" or \"-de\" for the locative case depending on vowel harmony. Since \"Brezilya\" ends in \"a\", the locative form should be \"Brezilya'da\".\n2. The second token's lemma \"isyan\" is a noun in the nominative case, which typically does not require any additional suffix for the nominative singular.\n3. The third token's lemma \"din\" is a verb. The verb is in the past tense, perfect aspect, third person singular, and affirmative. The typical past tense suffix for a verb in Turkish is \"-di\", adjusted for vowel harmony and consonant mutation if necessary. For \"din\", it becomes \"dindi\".\n\nThus, combining these with appropriate spacing and considering Turkish syntax (subject before verb), the sentence would likely be:\n\n**\"Brezilya'da isyan dindi.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"The rebellion in Brazil has calmed down\" or \"subsided\".\n\nThe JSON format of the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Brezilya'da isyan dindi.\"}\n```"

        "output": "Based on the given lemmas, parts of speech, morphological features, and dependency relations for each token, we can reconstruct the surface form of the Turkish sentence. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Bu arada** - \"Bu\" is a determiner for \"arada\" (locative case of \"ara\" meaning 'meanwhile' or 'in the meantime').\n2. **Öz** - This is a proper noun in genitive case indicating possession.\n3. **1.5 yıl önce** - \"1.5\" modifies \"yıl\" (year), and \"önce\" (before) is an adposition modifying \"yıl\".\n4. **otomobiliyle** - \"otomobil\" is in the instrumental case, indicating the means by which something happened. The suffix \"-iyle\" combines both possessive and instrumental markers.\n5. **bir apartman görevlisinin oğlunu** - \"Bir\" (a) is a determiner for \"apartman\" (apartment). \"Görevli\" is a noun (\"attendant\") in possessive form, modified by \"apartman\", and \"oğlunu\" is the accusative form of \"oğul\" (son), indicating the object of the action, possessed by \"görevli\".\n6. **çarparak** - \"çarp\" is a verb in participle form with the suffix \"-arak\" indicating the manner or means ('by hitting').\n7. **ölümüne sebep olduğunu** - \"Ölümüne\" (to his death, dative case of \"ölüm\") is an oblique argument of \"sebep\" (cause). \"Olduğunu\" is a compound verb form (\"ol\" + evidential/past participle suffix \"-duğu\" and accusative marker \"-nu\") indicating that the previous phrase is a realized fact or cause.\n8. **ön sürüldü** - \"ön\" (front) as an adjective but here likely in a compound verb form with \"sür\" (to claim, suggest), and \"-üldü\" is a passive voice marker in past tense.\n9. **.** - Ending punctuation.\n\nPutting all these components together, the sentence in Turkish would be:\n\n**\"Bu arada Öz'ün 1.5 yıl önce otomobiliyle bir apartman görevlisinin oğlunu çarparak ölümüne sebep olduğunu ön sürüldü.\"**\n\nThis translates roughly to: \"Meanwhile, it is claimed that Öz caused the death of an apartment attendant's son by hitting him with his car 1.5 years ago.\"\n\nLet's format this solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Bu arada Öz'ün 1.5 yıl önce otomobiliyle bir apartman görevlisinin oğlunu çarparak ölümüne sebep olduğunu ön sürüldü.\"\n}\n```"

The noun needs to take a dative ending, which in Turkish for most singular nouns is \"-e\" or \"-a\" depending on vowel harmony. Since \"alışveriş\" ends with a soft consonant and the last vowel is \"i\", it takes \"-e\".\n- **çıkar** (verb, nominative, imperative, singular, third person, converb) serves as an adverbial clause modifier.

The first token is \"Çin\" with lemma \"Çin,\" a proper noun in the ablative case. In Turkish, the ablative case is marked by the suffixes \"-den,\" \"-dan,\" \"-ten,\" or \"-tan\" depending on vowel harmony. Because \"Çin\" ends in a vowel, the ablative case would be formed with \"-den\" or \"-dan\". Based on vowel harmony, it would be \"Çin'den\".\n\n2. The second token is \"Dünya\" with lemma \"Dünya,\" a noun in the nominative case, singular number, and third person. It acts as a possessive nominal modifier to the third token. In Turkish, possessive relationships are shown using possessive suffixes added to the possessed noun. Since the possessor is singular, the suffix \"-nın,\" \"-nin,\" \"-nun,\" or \"-nün\" would be appropriate. Again, based on vowel harmony, the suffix \"-nın\" is suitable, thus \"Dünya'nın\".\n\n3. The third token is \"rekor\" with lemma \"rekor,\" a noun in the nominative case, singular number, and third person. As the root of the sentence, \"rekor\" remains unchanged.\n\nCombining all these elements considering Turkish syntax and morphology, the sentence would correctly be formed as:\n\n**\"Çin'den Dünya'nın rekoru.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"The world record from China.\"\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Çin'den Dünya'nın rekoru.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To construct the surface form of the sentence from the provided morphological and syntactic analysis, we must first correctly inflect each lemma based on its part of speech, number, person, case, and other features. The Turkish language uses agglutinative suffixes to reflect these grammatical categories. Let's analyze and build the sentence step-by-step:\n\n1. **Erken**: This lemma usually means \"early\" as an adjective, but here it's classified as a noun in the ablative case, which suggests it should be something like \"from early on\" - **Erkenden** (using the common ablative suffix -den for temporal expressions).\n   \n2. **mutfak**: A noun in the dative case, meaning \"to/into the kitchen\" - **mutfağa** (the letter 'k' changes to 'ğ' before the vowel-starting dative suffix -a).\n\n3. **gir**: A verb, here in the imperative form as suggested by its use in an adverbial clause modifier (suggesting an action to be performed), \"enter!\" - **gir**.\n\n4. **tüm**: A determiner, \"all\" - **tüm**.\n\n5. **hüner**: A noun in the accusative case, indicating direct object, plural and possessed by the first person singular. The surface form for \"all my skills\" would be **tüm hünerlerimi** (accusative plural suffix -leri and first person singular possessive suffix -m, plus accusative suffix -i).\n\n6. **sergile**: A verb in the past tense, first person singular, perfect aspect, and first hand evidentiality, meaning \"I have shown\" - **sergiledim** (past tense suffix -di and first person singular suffix -m).\n\n7. **.**: Simply a period - **.**\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence in Turkish would read:\n\n**\"Erkenden mutfağa gir, tüm hünerlerimi sergiledim.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"Enter the kitchen early, I have shown all my skills.\"\n\nThus, the JSON representation of the original form of this sentence is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Erkenden mutfağa gir, tüm hünerlerimi sergiledim.\"}\n```"
