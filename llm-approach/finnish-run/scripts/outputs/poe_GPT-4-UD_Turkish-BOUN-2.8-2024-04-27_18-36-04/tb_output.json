The first token's lemma \"Brezilya\" is a proper noun in the locative case. Turkish uses the suffix \"-da\" or \"-de\" for the locative case depending on vowel harmony. Since \"Brezilya\" ends in \"a\", the locative form should be \"Brezilya'da\".\n2. The second token's lemma \"isyan\" is a noun in the nominative case, which typically does not require any additional suffix for the nominative singular.\n3. The third token's lemma \"din\" is a verb. The verb is in the past tense, perfect aspect, third person singular, and affirmative. The typical past tense suffix for a verb in Turkish is \"-di\", adjusted for vowel harmony and consonant mutation if necessary. For \"din\", it becomes \"dindi\".\n\nThus, combining these with appropriate spacing and considering Turkish syntax (subject before verb), the sentence would likely be:\n\n**\"Brezilya'da isyan dindi.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"The rebellion in Brazil has calmed down\" or \"subsided\".\n\nThe JSON format of the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Brezilya'da isyan dindi.\"}\n```"

        "output": "Based on the given lemmas, parts of speech, morphological features, and dependency relations for each token, we can reconstruct the surface form of the Turkish sentence. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Bu arada** - \"Bu\" is a determiner for \"arada\" (locative case of \"ara\" meaning 'meanwhile' or 'in the meantime').\n2. **Öz** - This is a proper noun in genitive case indicating possession.\n3. **1.5 yıl önce** - \"1.5\" modifies \"yıl\" (year), and \"önce\" (before) is an adposition modifying \"yıl\".\n4. **otomobiliyle** - \"otomobil\" is in the instrumental case, indicating the means by which something happened. The suffix \"-iyle\" combines both possessive and instrumental markers.\n5. **bir apartman görevlisinin oğlunu** - \"Bir\" (a) is a determiner for \"apartman\" (apartment). \"Görevli\" is a noun (\"attendant\") in possessive form, modified by \"apartman\", and \"oğlunu\" is the accusative form of \"oğul\" (son), indicating the object of the action, possessed by \"görevli\".\n6. **çarparak** - \"çarp\" is a verb in participle form with the suffix \"-arak\" indicating the manner or means ('by hitting').\n7. **ölümüne sebep olduğunu** - \"Ölümüne\" (to his death, dative case of \"ölüm\") is an oblique argument of \"sebep\" (cause). \"Olduğunu\" is a compound verb form (\"ol\" + evidential/past participle suffix \"-duğu\" and accusative marker \"-nu\") indicating that the previous phrase is a realized fact or cause.\n8. **ön sürüldü** - \"ön\" (front) as an adjective but here likely in a compound verb form with \"sür\" (to claim, suggest), and \"-üldü\" is a passive voice marker in past tense.\n9. **.** - Ending punctuation.\n\nPutting all these components together, the sentence in Turkish would be:\n\n**\"Bu arada Öz'ün 1.5 yıl önce otomobiliyle bir apartman görevlisinin oğlunu çarparak ölümüne sebep olduğunu ön sürüldü.\"**\n\nThis translates roughly to: \"Meanwhile, it is claimed that Öz caused the death of an apartment attendant's son by hitting him with his car 1.5 years ago.\"\n\nLet's format this solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Bu arada Öz'ün 1.5 yıl önce otomobiliyle bir apartman görevlisinin oğlunu çarparak ölümüne sebep olduğunu ön sürüldü.\"\n}\n```"

The noun needs to take a dative ending, which in Turkish for most singular nouns is \"-e\" or \"-a\" depending on vowel harmony. Since \"alışveriş\" ends with a soft consonant and the last vowel is \"i\", it takes \"-e\".\n- **çıkar** (verb, nominative, imperative, singular, third person, converb) serves as an adverbial clause modifier.

The first token is \"Çin\" with lemma \"Çin,\" a proper noun in the ablative case. In Turkish, the ablative case is marked by the suffixes \"-den,\" \"-dan,\" \"-ten,\" or \"-tan\" depending on vowel harmony. Because \"Çin\" ends in a vowel, the ablative case would be formed with \"-den\" or \"-dan\". Based on vowel harmony, it would be \"Çin'den\".\n\n2. The second token is \"Dünya\" with lemma \"Dünya,\" a noun in the nominative case, singular number, and third person. It acts as a possessive nominal modifier to the third token. In Turkish, possessive relationships are shown using possessive suffixes added to the possessed noun. Since the possessor is singular, the suffix \"-nın,\" \"-nin,\" \"-nun,\" or \"-nün\" would be appropriate. Again, based on vowel harmony, the suffix \"-nın\" is suitable, thus \"Dünya'nın\".\n\n3. The third token is \"rekor\" with lemma \"rekor,\" a noun in the nominative case, singular number, and third person. As the root of the sentence, \"rekor\" remains unchanged.\n\nCombining all these elements considering Turkish syntax and morphology, the sentence would correctly be formed as:\n\n**\"Çin'den Dünya'nın rekoru.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"The world record from China.\"\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Çin'den Dünya'nın rekoru.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To construct the surface form of the sentence from the provided morphological and syntactic analysis, we must first correctly inflect each lemma based on its part of speech, number, person, case, and other features. The Turkish language uses agglutinative suffixes to reflect these grammatical categories. Let's analyze and build the sentence step-by-step:\n\n1. **Erken**: This lemma usually means \"early\" as an adjective, but here it's classified as a noun in the ablative case, which suggests it should be something like \"from early on\" - **Erkenden** (using the common ablative suffix -den for temporal expressions).\n   \n2. **mutfak**: A noun in the dative case, meaning \"to/into the kitchen\" - **mutfağa** (the letter 'k' changes to 'ğ' before the vowel-starting dative suffix -a).\n\n3. **gir**: A verb, here in the imperative form as suggested by its use in an adverbial clause modifier (suggesting an action to be performed), \"enter!\" - **gir**.\n\n4. **tüm**: A determiner, \"all\" - **tüm**.\n\n5. **hüner**: A noun in the accusative case, indicating direct object, plural and possessed by the first person singular. The surface form for \"all my skills\" would be **tüm hünerlerimi** (accusative plural suffix -leri and first person singular possessive suffix -m, plus accusative suffix -i).\n\n6. **sergile**: A verb in the past tense, first person singular, perfect aspect, and first hand evidentiality, meaning \"I have shown\" - **sergiledim** (past tense suffix -di and first person singular suffix -m).\n\n7. **.**: Simply a period - **.**\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence in Turkish would read:\n\n**\"Erkenden mutfağa gir, tüm hünerlerimi sergiledim.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"Enter the kitchen early, I have shown all my skills.\"\n\nThus, the JSON representation of the original form of this sentence is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Erkenden mutfağa gir, tüm hünerlerimi sergiledim.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To determine the surface form of the sentence from the provided morphosyntactic analysis, we need to understand the Turkish morphological rules and syntactic structures. Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. **yatırım** - as a noun in the accusative case: Typically, singular nouns in the accusative case take the suffix \"-i\" or \"-ı\" depending on vowel harmony. \"yatırım\" ends in a back vowel ('ı'), so it gets \"-ı\" -> \"yatırımı\".\n\n2. **Bolu** - as a proper noun in the dative case: The dative suffix is \"-e\" or \"-a\" following vowel harmony. Since \"Bolu\" ends in a front vowel ('u'), it takes \"-a\" -> \"Bolu'ya\".\n\n3. **kay** - as a causative verb in the past tense, perfect aspect, and first-hand evidentiality: The verb root \"kay\" will take a causative suffix, past tense suffix, and evidentiality marking. The causative can be \"-dir\", \"-tir\" or similar variants, and the past tense can be marked by \"-di\". The evidentiality in Turkish does not typically affect the verb's final surface form directly in the standard dialect. Thus, considering vowel harmony and causative formation, it's likely \"kaydırdı\".\n\n4. **...** - this remains unchanged as punctuation.\n\nCombining all these, the sentence is: \"Bolu'ya yatırımı kaydırdı...\"\n\nHere's your JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Bolu'ya yatırımı kaydırdı...\"}\n```"

Here's the breakdown of each token based on the provided lemmas and their morphological features:\n\n1. **1st token \"çevre\"**: This noun is in the locative case, singular number, and indicates possession by a first-person singular possessor. This would be \"çevremde\" (in my environment).\n2. **2nd token \"insan\"**: Although labeled as an adverb, context suggests this might be a typo or error since \"insan\" (human/person) is typically a noun. For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume it is meant to be an adjective describing \"küçük\", thus \"insan\" remains \"insan\" (human).\n3. **3rd token \"daha\"**: This adverb means \"more\" and modifies the adjective \"küçük\".\n4. **4th token \"küçük\"**: This noun is in the nominative case, singular number, and indicates possession by a first person singular possessor. This would be \"küçüğüm\" (I am small).\n5. **5th token \".\"**: This punctuation marks the end of the sentence.\n\nCombining these elements, the surface form of the sentence is:\n\n**\"Çevremde insan daha küçüğüm.\"**\n\nThis sentence can be interpreted as \"In my environment, more human, I am small.\" However, the grammatical structure is unusual, and it seems there may be typographical errors in the original task description.

        "output": "To determine the surface form of the sentence from the provided linguistic features, we need to understand each token's role and morphology in context:\n\n1. **First Token:** \"anla\"\n   - **Part of Speech:** Verb\n   - **Case:** Dative\n   - **Number:** Singular\n   - **Person:** Third person\n   - **Affirmative**\n   - **Role:** Depending on the 2nd token with a nominal modifier relationship suggests it functions like a gerund or infinitive, modifying the main verb. In Turkish, the dative case ending for gerund-like forms is typically \"-a\" or \"-e\". Thus, \"anla\" as a gerund would be \"anlaya\".\n\n2. **Second Token:** \"çalış\"\n   - **Part of Speech:** Verb\n   - **Aspect:** Progressive\n   - **Number:** Singular\n   - **Person:** First person\n   - **Tense:** Present\n   - **Affirmative**\n   - **Role:** Root token of the sentence. The progressive aspect in Turkish often uses \"-yor\". Thus, \"çalışıyorum\" (I am working).\n\n3. **Third Token:** \"iş\"\n   - **Part of Speech:** Adverb\n   - **Role:** Adverbial modifier to the verb. \"iş\" as an adverb can be used to mean \"indeed\" or \"actually\", modifying how the action is being carried out.\n\n4. **Fourth Token:** \"...\"\n   - **Part of Speech:** Punctuation\n   - **Role:** Punctuation, marking the end of the sentence.\n\nCombining these insights into a coherent sentence structure in Turkish:\n\n- The gerund form \"anlaya\" modifies the main action, expressing something like \"in understanding\".\n- \"Çalışıyorum\" expresses the ongoing action, \"I am working\".\n- \"iş\" as an adverb modifies the verb to add emphasis or an aspect of realization.\n- The punctuation marks the end of the sentence.\n\nThus, the sentence in Turkish could be:\n\n**\"Anlaya çalışıyorum iş...\"**\n\nRepresenting this in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Anlaya çalışıyorum iş...\"}\n```"

The given details on parts of speech, case, number, and dependency relations help in assembling the tokens in a meaningful syntax.\n\nGiven the root token is \"kat\" (verb, genitive case, singular, third person), and how other tokens are related to it and each other, we can derive the following:\n\n1. \"Daha sonra\" functions as a time expression, modifying the upcoming verb phrase.\n2. \"Çırp\" and \"ver\" are linked, forming a verb compound \"çırpıp ver\" (whip and give), which is a common way to combine verbs in Turkish.\n3. \"Kaynar sebze Sudan\" is a noun phrase where \"Kaynar\" (boiling) and \"sebze\" (vegetable) modify \"Sudan\" (from the vegetable broth), describing the origin or type of the broth.\n4. \"Kaşık kaşık\" indicates the manner in which the action is done – in this case, \"spoon by spoon\".\n5. The verbs \"al\" (take) followed by \"kat\" (add) construct the main action of the sentence, with \"al\" depending on \"kat\" for the complete action description.\n6. The phrase \"terbiye iç\" forms a noun phrase \"terbiye içi\" (inside the sauce), where \"terbiye\" (sauce) is modified by \"iç\" (inside), showing the location or part involved in the action.\n\nPutting these elements together in a structured sentence:\n\n**\"Daha sonra çırpıp ver, kaynar sebze sudan kaşık kaşık al, terbiye içine kat.\"**\n\nThis translates to an instruction likely found in cooking, meaning \"Then whip and give, take spoon by spoon from the boiling vegetable broth, and add into the sauce.\"\n\nThe JSON format for the sentence would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Daha sonra çırpıp ver, kaynar sebze sudan kaşık kaşık al, terbiye içine kat.\"}\n```"

The correct form for the genitive plural of \"siz\" is \"sizin\".\n- \"soy\" is the nominal subject of the main clause.\n- \"neden\" serves as an adverb modifying the verb, questioning the reason.\n- \"git\" as a noun seems to be an error since it is described as the root and is expected to be a verb in this context, particularly since it serves as the main predicate. The correct verb form for \"git\" (go) would be \"gidiyor\" (is going) to match the structure and meaning more appropriately.\n\nConsidering these corrections and the Turkish sentence structure, the original form of the sentence should be:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Ama sizin soy neden gidiyor?\"}"

The ablative case suffix for \"kalın\" would be \"-dan\" or \"-den\" depending on vowel harmony, making it \"kalından\".\n6. The lemma \"Roman\" is a verb here, plural number, third person. The parse suggests a verb form like \"Romanlar\" if it is treated as a noun in nominative plural; however, given its role as a verb, we should consider it more as \"romanlar\" (they are novels) if that was the intended meaning. But as it stands, there seems to be a parsing or lemma error since \"Roman\" as a verb does not align with Turkish grammar. Assuming it's intended as a nominal form in a verb-like role, \"romanlar\" stands.\n7. The lemma \"...\" is an ellipsis punctuation mark.\n\nCombining these elements, the sentence in Turkish would be:\n\n**\"Videoda filmler, en kalından romanlar...\"**\n\nThis construction follows the provided parse information and adheres to Turkish grammar and morphology rules.

In Turkish, the accusative case is indicated by the suffix \"-i\" on singular nouns ending with a vowel. Therefore, the surface form is \"ekmeği\".\n\n2. **Deniz** - The lemma is \"deniz\" (sea), marked as ablative and singular. The ablative case is generally indicated by the suffix \"-den\" or \"-dan\" depending on vowel harmony. Thus, the surface form is \"denizden\".\n\n3. **Çık** - This verb is in causative voice, past tense, perfect aspect, third person singular, positive and affirmative, and first-hand evidentiality. The causative of \"çık\" (to go out) is \"çıkart\" and in past tense, with first-hand evidentiality, it becomes \"çıkardı\".\n\n4. **Bu** - A determiner \"bu\" (this) remains unchanged as it is not inflected.\n\n5. **Deniz** - This lemma is also \"deniz\", in the nominative case. It is a possessive nominal modifier, indicating possession to \"insan\". The possessive marker for third person singular possessor is \"-i\". Thus, it becomes \"denizi\".\n\n6. **İnsan** - The lemma \"insan\" (person) is plural and nominative, with a singular possessor. To denote plural, the noun takes the suffix \"-lar\". Since it is owned, it should show agreement with the possessed \"denizi\", making it \"bu denizin insanları\".\n\n7. **.** - The punctuation mark \".\" remains as is.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Ekmek denizden bu denizin insanları çıkardı.\"}\n```"
