        "output": "Based on the given linguistic features, the surface form of the Turkish sentence would be:\n\n\"O da konuk da.\"\n\nThe JSON representation of the answer is:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"O da konuk da.\"}\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The root token is \"o\", which is a 3rd person singular personal pronoun in the genitive case.\n2. The 2nd token is \"da\", a particle that emphasizes the root token.\n3. The 3rd token is a comma, acting as a punctuation that separates the root token and the following part of the sentence.\n4. The 4th token is \"konuk\", a noun in the genitive case, connected to the root token as a conjunct.\n5. The 5th token is \"da\", another particle that emphasizes the noun \"konuk\".\n6. The 6th token is the final punctuation, the period.\n\nCombining all tokens in the given order, we obtain the surface form \"O da konuk da.\". The sentence features the pronoun \"o\" (he/she) and the noun \"konuk\" (guest) both in the genitive case, connected by the particle \"da\", emphasizing the relationship between the two. The additional \"da\" particles further emphasize the noun \"konuk\". The sentence is a simple statement with a subject (the genitive \"o\") and a noun modified by the genitive \"konuk\". The punctuation at the end of the sentence denotes the completion of the statement. The sentence could be translated to English as \"His/her guest as well.\" or \"Also his/her guest.\". The exact meaning depends on the context in which the sentence is used. The context is not provided in the given linguistic features, so the translation is an approximation. The sentence structure is clear and grammatically correct, but the lack of context may lead to varying interpretations in English.\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nReferences:\n- Turkish grammar and morphology\n- English grammar and morphology\n- Turkish-English translation resources\n- Morphological analysis and parsing of Turkish sentences\n- Natural Language Processing techniques and tools\n- Knowledge of the linguistic features provided in the input\n- General understanding of Turkish language, grammar, and context.\n\nNote: The provided information is accurate to the best of my knowledge, based on the given input and the resources I have access to.

For example, the sentence can also be written as \"Organun tam kısmi kopmuş yerine basınç uygulanır, kalp seviyesinden yukarı kaldırılır.\" with the same meaning. The word order in the sentence may vary depending on the context and the emphasis the speaker wants to give. In this example, the speaker emphasizes the action of \"raising\" by placing it at the end of the sentence. The word order in the sentence can also be changed to convey different meanings or emphases. For example, the sentence can be written as \"Kalp seviyesinden yukarı kaldırılır, basınç uygulanır\" to emphasize the action of \"raising\" or as \"Basınç uygulanır, kalp seviyesinden yukarı kaldırılır\" to emphasize the action of \"applying pressure\". The choice of the word order depends on the context and the speaker's intention. The given sentence is just one possible word order that conveys the intended meaning. Other word orders are also possible and meaningful. In this answer, I only provide one possible word order for the given sentence. The word order in the sentence can be changed to convey different meanings or emphases depending on the context and the speaker's intention.

        "prompt": "The following sentences detail linguistic features of a Turkish sentence with lemmas, parts of speech, morphological features and dependencies given for each token.\n\nThe sentence has 6 tokens.\n\n1st token's lemma is \"tabii\", its part of speech is adjective, and it depends on the 5th token with the relation of discourse element.\n2nd token's lemma is \"o\", its part of speech is determiner, and it depends on the 3rd token with the relation of determiner.\n3rd token's lemma is \"zaman\", its part of speech is noun, its case is nominative, its number is plural number, its person is third person, and it depends on the 5th token with the relation of oblique argument or adjunct.\n4th token's lemma is \"şeker\", its part of speech is noun, its case is nominative, its number is singular number, its person is third person, and it depends on the 5th token with the relation of nominal subject.\n5th token's lemma is \"bil\", its part of speech is verb, its aspect is imperfect aspect, its number is singular number, its person is third person, it is negative, its tense is present tense, its voice is passive voice, and it's the root token.\n6th token's lemma is \".\", its part of speech is punctuation, and it depends on the 5th token with the relation of punctuation.\n\nYour task is to find the surface form of the sentence. For example, your answer for the previous parse should be:\n\nTabii o zamanlar şeker bilinmiyor.\n\nNow, analyze the following test example and try to find the surface form of the sentence. It has 7 tokens. Please include all the tokens in your answer in order.\n\n1st token's lemma is \"renk\", its part of speech is noun, its case is nominative, its number is plural number, its person is third person, and it depends on the 2nd token with the relation of nominal subject.\n2nd token's lemma is \"sahte\", its part of speech is adjective, and it's the root token.\n3rd token's lemma is \"ve\", its part of speech is coordinating conjunction, and it depends on the 4th token with the relation of coordinating conjunction.\n4th and 5th tokens make up a single word.\n4th token's lemma is \"karmakarışık\", its part of speech is adjective, and it depends on the 2nd token with the relation of conjunct.\n5th token's lemma is \"y\", its part of speech is auxiliary verb, its aspect is perfect aspect, its mood is indicative, its number is singular number, its person is third person, its tense is past tense, and it depends on the 4th token with the relation of copula.\n6th token's lemma is \"çünkü\", its part of speech is coordinating conjunction, and it depends on the 2nd token with the relation of coordinating conjunction.\n7th token's lemma is \"...\", its part of speech is punctuation, and it depends on the 2nd token with the relation of punctuation.\n\nAnswer in JSON, in the following format:\n\n{\"original_form\": <SENTENCE>}",
        "output": "Here is the surface form of the sentence based on the given linguistic features:\n\n{\"original\\_form\": \"Sahte renkler ve karmakarışık y, çünkü...\"}\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The root token is the adjective \"sahte\" (fake), which is the first word in the sentence.\n* The second token is a plural noun \"renkler\" (colors) with a nominative case, which depends on the root token as its nominal subject.\n* The third token is a coordinating conjunction \"ve\" (and) that connects the adjective \"sahte\" with the following adjective \"karmakarışık\".\n* The fourth and fifth tokens are the single word \"karmakarışık\" (contrasting), which is an adjective that modifies the root token \"sahte\" as its conjunct.\n* The sixth token is an auxiliary verb \"y\" (was/were) with a perfect aspect, indicative mood, past tense, singular number, and third person. It depends on the fourth and fifth tokens as its copula.\n* The seventh token is an ellipsis \"...\" (three dots) that is a punctuation mark and depends on the root token as its punctuation.\n\nPutting all the tokens together, we get the surface form \"Sahte renkler ve karmakarışık y, çünkü...\". However, since the fifth token \"y\" is an auxiliary verb, it is often omitted in Turkish, and we can simplify the sentence as \"Sahte renkler ve karmakarışık çünkü...\".\n\nNote that the sentence is incomplete, as it lacks a main verb that can connect the nominal subject and the oblique argument or adjunct. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a fully meaningful translation of the sentence without additional context. However, the surface form is correct based on the given linguistic features.\n\nI hope this helps!
