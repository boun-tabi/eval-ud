        "output": "Based on the morphological and syntactic details provided, the surface form of the sentence can be constructed by understanding the grammatical relations and features of Basque language such as verb forms, cases, and dependency relations. Here's how it is constructed:\n\n1. **kezkatu** - verb, inessive case, has a dependency with the second token (hasi) as an adverbial clause modifier.\n2. **hasi** - verb, absolutive case, links to the fourth token (izan) as an adverbial clause modifier.\n3. **goiz** - adverb, modifies the verb izan indicating a time-related adverbial modifier.\n4. **izan** - verb, links to the fifth token (esan) as a clausal complement, indicating progressive aspect and indicative mood.\n5. **esan** - verb, root token, indicative mood and progressive aspect.\n6. **Lotina** - proper noun in the ergative case, acting as a subject to the verb esan.\n7. **.** - punctuation, marks the end of the sentence.\n\nThe verbs \"kezkatu\" and \"hasi\" are likely linked in a causative or sequential relationship, typical for Basque verb chains. The adverb \"goiz\" modifies the verb \"izan\" to specify the time. The main clause is \"esan\". \n\nThe sentence might be structured to mean something like \"Lotina has said that it has been starting to get worried early.\" This arrangement fits the dependencies and the roles assigned to each token. Therefore, the surface form might be:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Goiz hasi da kezkatzen Lotinak esan du.\"}\n\nThis sentence translates the grammatical structures into a coherent Basque sentence:\n- \"Goiz\" (early) as an adverbial modifier to \"hasi\" (begin).\n- \"kezkatzen\" reflects the progressive form linked with \"hasi\".\n- \"Lotinak\" (Lotina in the ergative case) as the subject to \"esan\" (said).\n- \"esan du\" as the main verb in the indicative, linking the entire sentence."

        "output": "To reconstruct the sentence from the given parse information, we need to understand the dependencies and roles of each word, and then fit them into a coherent sentence in Basque. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements:\n\n1. **Root Verb**: The 3rd token \"pasatu\" is the root verb in participle form with the auxiliary (4th token \"izan\") indicating it is in a past perfect construction.\n2. **Subject and Modifiers**: The 1st token \"labezomorro\" is the subject modified by the numeral \"bat\" (2nd token).\n3. **Adpositions and Determiners**: The 5th token \"bera\" acts as a determiner for the nominal \"aurre\" (6th token), which is a case marker.\n4. **Oblique Nominals and Punctuation**: The 8th token \"patxada\" is an oblique nominal, and along with \"inguru\" (10th token), which is modified by the adjective \"axolagabe\" (11th token), forms part of the sentence structure before the conjunction.\n5. **Conjunction and Clauses**: The 13th token \"eta\" is a conjunction linking two clauses.\n6. **Second Clause**: The 18th token \"marraztu\" is another verb in participle form with an auxiliary (19th token \"izan\"). The subject \"irribarre\" modified by \"konplize\" (15th and 16th tokens) and \"bat\" (17th token) indicates another past perfect construction.\n7. **Indirect Object and Oblique Nominal**: \"amona\" (14th token) serves as an indirect object, and \"aurpegi\" (20th token) serves as an oblique nominal.\n\nCombining these elements into a coherent Basque sentence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Labezomorro bat pasatu izan da bera aurrean, patxada, inguru axolagabe, eta amonari irribarre konplize bat marraztu izan dio aurpegian.\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sentence can be translated to English as follows: \"A spider has passed before it, with ease, indifferent surroundings, and drew a complicit smile on grandmother's face.\" This translation captures the essence of the sentence structure and semantic content, keeping in mind the participle constructions and the roles of the auxiliaries."

The lemma \"marka\" is a noun in the absolutive case, definite, singular, and serves as the direct object of the verb \"prestatu\". \n2. \"Prestatu\" is a verb in the instrumental/instructive case, definite, singular, and forms an adverbial clause that modifies the root verb \"egin\".\n3. \"Gain\" is a noun in the absolutive case, indefinite, and modifies \"prestatu\" as an adverbial clause modifier.\n4. The comma (\",\") follows directly after \"gain\".\n5. \"Zer\" is a determiner for \"jardun\".\n6. \"Jardun\" is a verb turned into a participle or verbal adjective, in the absolutive case, indefinite, and serves as the direct object of \"egin\".\n7. \"Egin\" is the root of the sentence, a verb in the perfect aspect, participle form.\n8. \"Edun\" is an auxiliary verb in the indicative mood with third person singular absolutive and second person singular ergative agreement, supporting \"egin\".\n9. \"Harri\" is a noun modifying \"egin\" as an oblique nominal.\n10. \"Handi\" is an adjective in the comitative/associative case, definite, plural, modifying \"harri\".\n11. The question mark (\"?\") serves as punctuation for the sentence.\n\nConstructing these components into a coherent Basque sentence, keeping in mind the typical Basque syntax and the dependencies outlined, the sentence might look like this:\n\n**\"Gain prestaturiko marka zer jardun egin edun harri handiekin?\"**\n\nThis translates the elements into a likely sentence structure in Basque, though some nuances of Basque grammar such as the exact placement of parts of speech in the sentence and possible auxiliary verbs or agreement markers may require adjustment based on deeper knowledge of the language.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Gain prestaturiko marka zer jardun egin edun harri handiekin?\"\n}\n```"

The sentence structure can be determined by following the dependencies and the parts of speech, taking into account grammatical cases, and verb forms. Here is the reconstruction:\n\n1. The quotation mark `\"` opens the sentence and is linked to the main verb \"etorri\" (6th token), indicating spoken or quoted content.\n2. \"ETA\" is a proper noun in the locative case modifying \"kide\" (3rd token), serving as an identifier or specifier.\n3. \"kide\" serves as the noun in a subordinate clause modified by \"izan\" (4th token) and is linked to the main clause's verb \"akusatu\" (5th token) as an adverbial clause modifier.\n4. \"izan\" is an auxiliary verb in the instrumental/instructive, functioning here likely as part of a past participle construction, indicating the past or completed aspect of being a \"kide.\"\n5. \"akusatu\" is a verb in participle form, modifying the main action \"etorri.\"\n6. \"etorri\" is the main verb in participle form, serving as the root of the sentence.\n7. The comma `,` sets off the upcoming list or continuation.\n8. \"eta\" serves as a coordinating conjunction, introducing the next clause.\n9. \"jaurlaritza\" is a noun in the dative case, which is the object of the preposition \"buruz.\"\n10. \"buruz\" is an adposition marking the case of \"jaurlaritza.\"\n11. \"baino\" is another modifier related to \"jaurlaritza,\" further specifying the relation or comparison.\n12. \"ez\" is a negative particle affecting the verb \"edun\" (13th token).\n13. \"edun\" is an auxiliary verb that agrees with different arguments in number and person, linked to the verb \"galdetu\" (14th token).\n14. \"galdetu\" is a verb in participle form, indicating a past or perfect action linked to \"etorri\" and modified by \"ez.\"\n15. The closing quotation mark `\"` ends the quoted or spoken part.\n16. The period `.` concludes the sentence.\n\nCombining these elements, the original form of the sentence could be:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"\\\"ETAkide izan dena akusatuta etorri, eta jaurlaritzari buruz baino ez du galdetu.\\\".\"}"

        "output": "Based on the analysis and the given dependencies along with the morphological information about the tokens, the surface form of the Basque sentence can be deduced as follows:\n\n- \"Edurnezuri\" is the absolutive subject of the clause.\n- \"printze\" is in the comitative case, implying association (\"with the prince\").\n- \"ezkondu izan\" forms a perfect aspect participle phrase (\"has been married\").\n- The comma serves as punctuation after this phrase.\n- \"zazpi ipotx\" refers to \"seven dwarfs\" where \"zazpi\" is a numeric modifier for the plural noun \"ipotx\".\n- \"edan\" is in the dative case, possibly reflecting an indirect object or beneficiary, though its typical meaning \"to drink\" seems contextually transformed here, possibly intended to mean something like \"for\" or \"to\".\n- \"eman\" is a participle form of the verb implying \"given\" or \"provided\".\n- \"edun\" as an auxiliary verb supports the complex verbal construction, indicating tense, mood, and agreement with the subject and objects.\n\nHence, the sentence likely translates to \"Snow White has been married to the prince, and the seven dwarfs have been given [something]\".\n\nGiven these considerations, the surface form in Basque, respecting typical syntactical structures, should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Edurnezuri printzearekin ezkondu izan da, zazpi ipotxek eman edan dute.\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this sentence:\n- \"printzearekin\" combines \"printze\" (prince) with the associative/comitative suffix \"-rekin\" (with).\n- \"ezkondu izan da\" uses \"izan\" as the auxiliary for the perfect aspect and \"da\" (is) as the indicative mood.\n- \"zazpi ipotxek\" indicates \"seven dwarfs\" as the subject in ergative case (due to plural and definite article).\n- \"eman edan dute\" uses the verb \"eman\" (to give) and \"edan\" which might be intended as \"have been given\" here, with \"dute\" (they have) as the auxiliary indicating plural ergative agreement."
