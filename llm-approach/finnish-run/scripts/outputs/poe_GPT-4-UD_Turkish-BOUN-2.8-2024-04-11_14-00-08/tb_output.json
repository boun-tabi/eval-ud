        "output": "To construct the surface form of the Turkish sentence from the given linguistic features, we will need to apply the correct morphological inflections to the lemmas according to the grammatical features provided. Here's how each token would be transformed:\n\n1. \"hafifçe\" remains the same as it's an adverb and does not inflect.\n2. \"renk\" is a singular noun in the accusative case, which typically takes the suffix \"-i\" to form \"rengi\".\n3. \"dön\" is a third person singular past tense verb with non-first hand evidentiality. In Turkish, non-first hand information is often indicated by the suffix \"-miş\". Therefore, the past tense form would be \"dönmüş\".\n4. \"patlıcan\" is a plural noun in the nominative case, which takes the plural suffix \"-lar\", forming \"patlıcanlar\".\n5. \"tepsi\" is a singular noun in the dative case, which typically takes the suffix \"-ye\" or \"-ya\" to form \"tepsiye\".\n6. \"yay\" is the main verb and is affirmative. The surface form would depend on the tense and other features, but since these are not provided, it is difficult to accurately provide its surface form.\n7. \"tuz\" is the root verb. As a first person singular verb, it might take the suffix \"-arım\" or \"-erim\" depending on vowel harmony, forming \"tuzlarım\" in the present tense. However, the case is instrumental, which is unusual for a verb. It may be an error in the provided features.\n8. \"Üzer\" is singular and dative but requires possessive agreement, forming \"üzerine\".\n9. \"hazırla\" is a past tense perfect participle, which should agree with the second person plural possessive. The participle form would be \"hazırlanmış\".\n10. \"köfte\" is a plural noun in the nominative case, taking the plural suffix \"-ler\", forming \"köfteler\".\n11. \"diz\" is a genitive pronoun, which is typically \"dizin\".\n12. \".\" remains the same as punctuation.\n\nNoting the above inflections and the dependencies among the tokens, the constructed sentence in Turkish, to the best of our understanding given the information and the potential errors in the features provided, would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Hafifçe rengi dönmüş patlıcanlar tepsisine yayılırken, üzerine hazırlanmış köfteleri dizlerim.\"}\n```\n\nThis sentence could mean: \"While the color of the eggplants gently changes, I arrange the prepared meatballs on its tray.\" However, due to the unusual instrumental case for the verb \"tuz\" and lack of tense information for \"yay\", this reconstruction may not be fully accurate."

        "output": "The sentence structure can be assembled based on the dependencies and morphological features of each token. Here's the process:\n\n1. The 1st token \"stat\" is an adjective in the genitive case and modifies the 8th token \"serüven\".\n2. The 2nd token \"i\" is an auxiliary verb in the conditional mood, suggesting that it should be attached to the 1st token, creating the possessive construction.\n3. The 3rd token \"uzun\" is an adjective modifying the 5th token \"öykü\".\n4. The 4th token \"bir\" is a determiner for the 5th token \"öykü\".\n5. The 5th token \"öykü\" is a noun in the dative case and serves as an oblique argument or adjunct to the 6th token \"dönüş\".\n6. The 6th token \"dönüş\" is a present participle and modifies the 8th token \"serüven\" as a clausal modifier.\n7. The 7th token \"talih\" is an adjective modifying the 8th token \"serüven\".\n8. The 8th token \"serüven\" is a noun in the nominative case and acts as the subject of the 10th token \"sür\".\n9. The 9th token \"hâlâ\" is an adverb modifying the 10th token \"sür\".\n10. The 10th token \"sür\" is the root verb in locative case, indicating a continuation.\n11. The 11th token is a punctuation mark.\n\nConsidering the above analysis and how Turkish syntax works:\n\n- The possessive construction for \"stat serüven\" would be \"statın serüveni\".\n- The present participle \"dönüş\" would attach to \"öykü\" to describe the \"serüven\", creating \"bir öyküye dönüş\".\n- The adjective \"uzun\" would precede \"bir öyküye\".\n- The adjective \"talih\" would precede \"serüven\".\n- The adverb \"hâlâ\" would precede the root verb \"sür\".\n\nThus, the surface form in Turkish would be:\n\n\"Statın uzun bir öyküye dönüş talih serüveni hâlâ sürüyor.\"\n\nRepresenting this in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Statın uzun bir öyküye dönüş talih serüveni hâlâ sürüyor.\"}\n```"

The tokens must be arranged in a syntactically coherent order, reflecting the dependencies provided.\n\nHere's the analysis for each token:\n\n1. \"bugün\" remains unchanged as it is a noun in nominative case and singular number, serving as an adjunct to the root token.\n2. \"cumhuriyet\" is a noun in genitive case, indicating possession. Since it is possessed by a first person plural subject (\"our\"), it should take the suffix \"-imiz\" to reflect \"our republic.\"\n3. \"onuncu\" is a numeric modifier that modifies the following noun, which is in accusative case.\n4. \"yıl\" is a noun in accusative case, marked by the accusative suffix, which is typically \"-i\" following a vowel harmony rule.\n5. \"dol\" is a verb in perfect aspect, past tense, causative voice, and is a participle modifying a noun. The form of the verb will reflect these attributes, likely resulting in \"dolduğu\" as the participle form indicating \"that/which is completed.\"\n6. \"en\" is an adverb that modifies the adjective following it.\n7. \"büyük\" is an adjective that modifies the root token \"bayram.\"\n8. \"bayram\" is the root token, and as an adposition, it is likely used in a nominal function here, meaning \"holiday\" or \"festival.\"\n9. \".\" is punctuation and will appear at the end of the sentence.\n\nConsidering these analyses, the surface form of the sentence in Turkish would be:\n\n\"Bugün Cumhuriyet'imizin onuncu yılını dolduğu en büyük bayram.\"\n\nRepresenting this in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Bugün Cumhuriyet'imizin onuncu yılını dolduğu en büyük bayram.\"}\n```"

        "output": "Based on the provided linguistic features, we can reconstruct the surface form of the sentence in Turkish. Each token will be transformed into its correct inflected form according to the provided grammatical features.\n\n1. \"1968\" is a proper noun in the locative case. In Turkish, the locative case is formed with the suffixes \"-de\" or \"-da\" following the rules of vowel harmony. Since \"1968\" ends with a vowel, the appropriate locative case suffix is \"-de\".\n2. \"Rus\" is a plural noun in the nominative case. In Turkish, the plural form is often indicated by the suffix \"-lar\" or \"-ler\" depending on vowel harmony. Since \"u\" is a back vowel, the correct plural suffix is \"-lar\".\n3. \"Prag\" is a proper noun in the dative case. The dative case in Turkish is formed with the suffix \"-e\" or \"-a\". Following vowel harmony, the correct suffix is \"-a\".\n4. \"gir\" is a verb in the affirmative form. The verb \"girmek\" means \"to enter\". It serves as an adverbial clause modifier to the main verb, so it should be in the form that corresponds to \"when X enters\".\n5. \"çift\" is an adjective and does not change form.\n6. \"Cenevre\" is a proper noun in the dative case. The dative case suffix, according to vowel harmony, is \"-e\".\n7. \"kaç\" is a habitual aspect verb in the present tense, third person singular. Habitual aspect in Turkish doesn't have a specific suffix but is understood from context. The present tense third person singular form of \"kaçmak\" (to escape) is \"kaçar\".\n8. \".\" is punctuation and remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the surface form of the sentence in Turkish would be:\n\n\"1968'de Ruslar Prag'a girer, çift Cenevre'ye kaçar.\"\n\nIn JSON format:\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"1968'de Ruslar Prag'a girer, çift Cenevre'ye kaçar.\"}\n```"

Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. \"anne\" is a singular noun in the nominative case with a first person singular possessor, which suggests the need for a possessive suffix. The correct form would be \"annem\" (my mother).\n2. \",\" is punctuation and will be used as such.\n3. \"dayı\" is a singular noun in the genitive case with a first person singular possessor, thus it would be \"dayımın\" (of my uncle).\n4. \"tekerleme\" is a singular noun in the nominative case; it will take a third person singular possessive suffix because it is modified by \"dayı\", which is in the genitive case. This gives us \"dayımın tekerlemesi\" (my uncle's tongue-twister).\n5. \"yön\" is a singular noun in the ablative case, which means it will take an ablative suffix. The correct form is \"yönden\" (from the direction).\n6. \"ilk\" is an adjective modifying \"kez,\" which means it will remain \"ilk\" (first).\n7. \"kez\" is an adverb and does not change.\n8. \"o\" is a determiner and will remain \"o\" (that/the).\n9. \"akşam\" is a singular noun in the nominative case, translating to \"akşam\" (evening).\n10. \"söz\" is the root noun in the nominative case, meaning \"söz\" (word, speech).\n11. \"et\" is a verb in perfect aspect, first-hand evidentiality, singular number, third person, affirmative, in past tense. This will be reflected as \"etti\" (said/spoke).\n12. \".\" is punctuation.\n\nPutting it all together in the correct order:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Annem, dayımın tekerlemesinden ilk kez o akşam söz etti.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To reconstruct the surface form of the sentence from the given linguistic features, we need to consider Turkish grammar, including how various affixes are attached to the lemmas to reflect the given morphological features and dependencies. Here's the process I followed:\n\n1. The locative case on \"Dünya\" suggests it should be \"Dünyada\" (in the world).\n2. \"en\" is an adverb meaning \"most\" and modifies \"önem\" (important), which typically doesn't change form.\n3. \"neyzen\" is a noun in the ablative plural case, which indicates it should be \"neyzenlerinden\" (from among the ney players).\n4. \"biri\" as an adverb is a bit unusual, but considering the structure, it is more likely to mean \"one of\" and should be attached to \"neyzenlerinden\" to make \"neyzenlerinden biri\".\n5. Since \"ol\" is an adposition that marks the case and \"biri\" is dependent on it, it's likely there is no change as \"biri\" already implies \"one of\".\n6. \"kabul\" is a noun in the nominative singular and will stay as \"kabul\".\n7. \"et\" is attached to \"kabul\" to form the light verb construction \"kabul edilen\" (which is accepted).\n8. \"umumi\" is a proper noun in the nominative singular and should be \"Umumi\" (General).\n9. \"ne\" has a possessive modifier which suggests \"senin\" (your) should be included, making \"senin ne\" (your what).\n10. \"hüzün\" modifies \"ne\" which should be \"hüzün ne\" (what sorrow).\n11. \"ses\" in the instrumental case typically takes the suffix \"-le\" and has possessive third person singular, making it \"sesiyle\" (with its voice).\n12. \"kendi\" is a reflexive pronoun that should modify \"yaşam\", resulting in \"kendi yaşamında\" (in its own life).\n13. \"acı\" is plural genitive, which should be \"acıların\" (of the pains).\n14. \"örtüş\" is a noun and will stay as \"örtüş\".\n15. \"söyle\" is the root verb in the present progressive, which should be \"söyleniyor\" (is being said).\n\nConsidering all these points and the punctuation, we can reconstruct the sentence as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"\\\"Dünyanın en önemli neyzenlerinden biri olarak kabul edilen Umumi, senin hüzün ne sesiyle kendi yaşamındaki acıların örtüşüyor.\\\" söyleniyor.\"}\n```"

The 3rd token \"tüm\" is in the accusative plural form, which should be \"tümünü\".\n4. Since the 4th token \"kullan\" is a verb in imperative mood and a converb, it should be used in the form that complements the main verb, which would be \"kullanarak\".\n5. The 5th token \"mekân\" is a singular noun in nominative case.\n6. The 6th token \"düzenle\" is a verb in dative case and it is a positive command, so it would be \"mekânını düzenle\".\n7. The 7th token \"de\" is a coordinating conjunction, serving as an intensifier for the previous verb, which would be \"de\".\n8. The 8th token \"gir\" is a present progressive, affirmative singular verb, which should be \"giriyor\".\n9.

        "output": "Before I give you the JSON answer, I will first construct the surface form of the sentence based on the provided linguistic features.\n\n1. \"Mutlu\" (with instrumental case) might be \"mutlulukla\" or \"mutluyla\" in Turkish, but \"mutluyla\" is not a standard form. Since it is a nominal modifier, it should modify a noun.\n2. \"Ara\" (with locative case, singular number, and possessive agreement of 1st person plural) would be \"aramızda\" (among us).\n3. \"Dur\" (participle, present tense, positive) would be \"duran\" (that/which is standing/staying).\n4. \"En\" is an adverb meaning \"most\".\n5. \"Büyük\" is an adjective meaning \"big\" or \"great\".\n6. \"Engel\" is a noun, but here it is listed as an adjective. Assuming this is a typo, and it should be a noun, since it's nominative, singular and third person, it would be \"engel\".\n7. \"Kendi\" is a reflexive noun, which would be \"kendimiz\" (ourselves) because it agrees with the possessive marker on \"mi\" (1st person plural).\n8. \"Mi\" is a question particle, which would be attached to the verb as \"muyuz\".\n9. \"Yok\" is an adjective meaning \"non-existent\" or \"no\".\n10. \"İ\" is a copula, which in this case would be \"yok ise\" (if there is not), but since this is connected to \"yok\", it should be combined to form \"yoksa\" as in conditional.\n11. \"?\" is the question mark punctuation.\n12. and 16. \"\"\" are quotation marks.\n13. \"500\" is the numeral \"500\".\n14. \"MGR\" is a noun and could be an abbreviation or a proper noun, so we'll keep it as \"MGR\".\n15. \".\" is the full stop punctuation.\n17. \"De\" (verb, perfect aspect, first-hand evidentiality, plural number, first person, past tense, positive) would be \"dedik\" (we said).\n18. \".\" is the full stop punctuation.\n\nThe 9th and 10th tokens combine to form \"yoksa\" which is a conditional form used in Turkish, so the \"yok\" and \"i\" do not form two separate words.\n\nTaking all these into account, the sentence in Turkish surface form would be:\n\n\"Mutlulukla aramızda duran en büyük engel kendimiz miyiz yoksa?\" \"500 MGR\" dedik.\n\nNow, in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Mutlulukla aramızda duran en büyük engel kendimiz miyiz yoksa? \\\"500 MGR\\\" dedik.\"}\n```"

It acts as a direct object in the sentence.\n9. \".\" is punctuation.\n\nCombining these elements and applying Turkish grammatical rules, the surface form of the sentence is:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"En azından ergen çağında tanışılmayacak kadın olmak zordur.\"}\n\nPlease note that the provided morphological analysis for token 7 (\"ol\") does not seem to be consistent with the standard structure of Turkish grammar, as verbs typically do not take genitive case. However, I've interpreted it as a nominal form related to the verb \"olmak\" (to be). There may also be a discrepancy with the possessive number of the possessor for the 8th token (\"zor\"), as the token is described as having a plural possessor, which is inconsistent with the rest of the sentence. I've chosen to interpret it as a singular possessor to fit the context of the sentence. If this interpretation is incorrect, additional context would be required to provide a more accurate translation."

        "output": "Based on the detailed linguistic features provided for each token in the Turkish sentence, we are to reconstruct the original form of the sentence. Turkish is an agglutinative language, meaning that it attaches various suffixes to a root word to add grammatical meaning. The given information includes lemmas, parts of speech, morphological features, and dependencies. With this information, we can determine the correct forms of the words and their order in the sentence. Here is the reconstructed sentence in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Herkes koşmuş İstanbul caddelerinde ister istemez katılmışsınız bu elinize maratona.\"\n}\n```\n\nJustification for each token:\n\n1. \"Herkes\" is the subject of the sentence, in the genitive case, suggesting possession or association.\n2. \"koş\" as a converb (imperative form used in context with another verb) indicates an action related to the subject. The perfect aspect and past tense are indicated by \"muş\".\n3. \"yürü\" as a participle modifies \"İstanbul\", carrying a perfect aspect and past tense, also indicated by \"muş\".\n4. \"İstanbul\" is the proper noun modified by the participle \"yürümuş\".\n5. \"cadde\" is the noun in plural form and locative case, which means the locative suffix \"lerinde\" is used.\n6. The comma \",\" is used as punctuation without change.\n7. \"iste\" is a verb in the habitual aspect, in the affirmative form. The habitual aspect (new proposal) is not standard in Turkish grammar descriptions, but we can assume it refers to a repeated action or general truth.\n8. The repeated \"iste\" could be a form of emphasis or reduplication in Turkish, often used for intensifying the meaning. Since it is negated, \"mez\" would be appended to make \"istemez\".\n9. \"kat\" is the main verb in passive voice, perfect aspect, in the past tense, and first-hand evidentiality. The correct form would be \"katılmışsınız\", indicating that the action was done by \"you\" (plural) and it is something that the speaker witnessed or has direct evidence of.\n10. \"bu\" is a determiner and does not change.\n11. \"el\" is a noun in locative case and is modified by \"siz\" to express \"to your hands\" or \"into your hands\", which translates to \"elinize\".\n12. \"siz\" is an adposition marking the case of \"el\", which is locative.\n13. \"maraton\" is the direct object in dative case, which necessitates the dative suffix \"a\".\n14. The period \".\" is punctuation and is used without change.\n\nPlease note that Turkish sentences can be quite flexible in terms of word order due to its rich inflectional system, which allows for various suffixes to convey meaning that in English would require strict word order. The sentence provided above captures the grammatical features outlined for each token."

        "output": "Based on the provided linguistic features, we need to construct the Turkish sentence by inferring the correct surface forms of the lemmas with appropriate inflections and suffixes, and also make sure to include the punctuation marks in their correct places. Here's the sentence constructed step by step:\n\n1. Opening quotation mark: \"\"\"\n2. \"mekân\" is a singular, nominative noun and the subject of the sentence.\n3. Closing quotation mark: \"\"\"\n4. \"Dey\" is a verb in equative case, which is typically used to mean \"like\" or \"as\" in English. It modifies the noun \"kişi\" to form a noun phrase meaning \"person who is like a place\". The verb should be in the form that is consistent with the equative case, which in Turkish would be \"dey\" as in \"deyen\" or a similar form.\n5. \"kişi\" is a singular, genitive noun, which means it will have a possessive suffix, serving as a modifier for the noun \"oda\".\n6. \"doğrudan\" is an adjective modifying the verb \"yaşa\".\n7. \"kendi\" is a pronoun that also modifies \"yaşa\".\n8. \"yaşa\" is a future tense participle verb, which means it will take a suffix that indicates future tense and a form that makes it function as an adjective or a noun modifier.\n9. \"oda\" is a plural nominative noun and the subject of a secondary clause.\n10. Comma: \",\"\n11. \"ev\" is a singular nominative noun and is in conjunction with \"oda\".\n12. \"VB\" is a noun and is also the root of the sentence. Since \"VB\" is represented as a part of speech and not an actual Turkish word, it could stand for a placeholder for the actual verb of the sentence. We will replace it with a generic verb \"var\" which means \"there is/are\".\n13. Period: \".\"\n\nNow, putting it all together and applying Turkish grammatical rules and inflections, we get:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"\\\"Mekân\\\" deyen kişinin doğrudan kendisi yaşayacağı odalar, ev var.\"}\n\nNote: The verb \"Dey\" and its exact form as used in the sentence is not standard, and without more context, it is difficult to render it accurately in Turkish. The same applies to the verb represented by \"VB\"; since it's a placeholder, we have used \"var\" as a commonly used verb to complete the sentence. The sentence might not be entirely grammatically correct without further context."

        "output": "To reconstruct the surface form of the sentence from the provided lemmas and morphosyntactic features, we need to apply the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. Let's construct the sentence token by token:\n\n1. \"chat\" is a noun in the nominative case, singular number, third person, and possesses the next noun \"vasıta\". In Turkish, possession is shown by adding a possessive suffix to the possessed noun. The singular third person possessive suffix is \"-i\" or \"-ı\" depending on vowel harmony. The correct one for \"chat\" is \"-i\", so it becomes \"chatı\".\n2. \"vasıta\" is a noun in the nominative case, singular number, third person, and is possessed by \"chat\". It is also modified by \"ile\" to indicate \"with/by means of\". The surface form will show the possessive relationship and the conjunction \"ile\".\n3. \"ile\" is a coordinating conjunction and will stay as \"ile\".\n4. \"tanı\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, possessed by the first person singular, affirmative, past tense, and in the participle form. It modifies \"insan\", and the possessive suffix for the first person singular is \"-m\". However, since it is a past participle used as an adjective, it will be \"tanıdığım\" to mean \"whom I recognized\".\n5. \"insan\" is a noun in the ablative case, plural number, third person, and possessed by \"tanıdığım\". The ablative case suffix for plural nouns is \"-lerden\" or \"-lardan\" following vowel harmony, and since it is possessed, it drops the plural suffix, resulting in \"insanlardan\".\n6. \",\" is punctuation and will be a comma in the sentence.\n7. \"çok\" is an adverb and will be \"çok\".\n8. \"sev\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, possessed by the first person singular, affirmative, past tense, and in the participle form. As a participle, it will be \"sevdiğim\", meaning \"whom I loved\".\n9. \"ve\" is a coordinating conjunction and will stay as \"ve\".\n10. \"değer\" is a noun in the nominative case, singular number, and third person. It will remain \"değer\".\n11. \"ver\" is a noun and part of a compound verb with \"değer\" to make \"değer vermek\" which means \"to value\". Since \"değer\" is a direct object and part of the verb phrase, it will combine with \"sevdiğim\" to form \"sevdiğim ve değer verdiğim\".\n12. \"ol\" is the main verb in the perfect aspect, first-hand evidentiality, singular number, third person, affirmative, and past tense. It is the root of the sentence. The past tense marker for third person singular is \"-di\" or \"-dı\", \"-du\", \"-dü\" depending on vowel harmony. The correct form is \"oldu\".\n13. \".\" is punctuation and will be a period in the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Chatı vasıta ile tanıdığım insanlardan, çok sevdiğim ve değer verdiğim oldu.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To reconstruct the surface form of the sentence, we must consider the morphological features and dependencies provided for each token. Turkish is an agglutinative language where suffixes are added to a base word to express grammatical functions such as case, number, possession, and tense. The given information indicates how the tokens are related within the sentence and what morphological changes should be applied to the lemmas. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. \"B\" is a proper noun in the nominative case, singular number, third person, and it modifies the 2nd token \"grup\" as a possessive modifier. In Turkish, possessive relationships are shown by adding a possession suffix to the owned noun (grup) and a corresponding possessive suffix to the owner noun (B). Since both are third person singular, the suffix '-in' would be added to \"grup\" to show possession, and 'B' would not take a possessive suffix.\n2. \"grup\" is a noun in the locative case, which indicates location or being at a place, usually formed by adding the suffix '-de' or '-da' to the noun (depending on vowel harmony). It also serves as an adjectival modifier to the 3rd token \"mücadele\".\n3. \"mücadele\" is also in the locative case, which would typically take the locative suffix '-de' or '-da'. This noun is modified by \"grup\" and acts as an oblique argument or adjunct to the 6th token \"lider\".\n4. \"i\" is an auxiliary verb with a conditional mood, and it acts as a copula to the 3rd token \"mücadele\". In Turkish conditional sentences, the verb \"ise\" (if it is) is often used, but since \"i\" is indicated as an auxiliary verb, it suggests that the conditional is being expressed through a suffix attached to the noun. However, given the structure of the sentence, this seems to be an error because there's no clear conditional construction in the information provided.\n5. \"grup\" is a noun in the nominative case, indicating it will not take a case marker, and acts as a possessive modifier to the 6th token \"lider\". It will take the possessive suffix '-in' or '-un' depending on vowel harmony to show that \"grup\" possesses \"lider\".\n6. \"lider\" is a noun in the nominative case and is the root of the sentence. The possessive relationship indicates that a third person singular possessive suffix '-i' or '-ı' should be attached to \"lider\" to show possession by \"grup\".\n7. \"g\" is a proper noun in the nominative case and acts as the subject of the sentence.\n8. The final token is punctuation, specifically a period, marking the end of the sentence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the reconstructed surface form of the sentence in Turkish could be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"B'nin grup mücadelesinde grup lideri G.\"}\n```\n\nHowever, the fourth token's lemma \"i\" is not reflected in the sentence because there is no clear conditional relationship indicated by the other tokens. The sentence structure and provided tokens suggest a descriptive sentence rather than a conditional one. If there were a conditional mood to express, it would likely involve a different construction possibly not captured in the test example's details."

It seems to be a redundancy or intensifier for \"açıkça.\"\n- \"görünüyor\" is the evidential, past tense, third person singular, positive form of \"gör\" (it appears).\n\nPlease note that the given tokens include some non-standard words or spellings (like \"unfree\", \"tenure\", \"lor\", and \"seçik\"), which are not Turkish and have been interpreted to the best of my ability given the context and standard Turkish grammar rules. There are also some ambiguities in the instructions such as the lack of clear possessive markers for \"tenure\" in both its occurrences. Additionally, \"lor\" does not correspond to a recognized Turkish word, and as such, it's treated as a proper noun and left as is."
