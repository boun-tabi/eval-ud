Since \"indar\" is in the ergative case and plural, it suggests a subject performing an action.\n- \"ez\" is a negative particle modifying the main verb \"egin\" (do/make).\n- \"ezer\" is a pronoun in the absolutive case serving as the object of \"egin.\"\n- \"egin\" (done) is the main verb in participle form and is the root of the sentence.\n- The phrase \"paramilitar geldiaraz\" involves the adjective \"paramilitar\" (paramilitary) modifying the verb \"geldiaraz\" (to stop causatively), indicating an action to causatively stop something described as paramilitary.\n- \"lekuko salatu\" involves \"lekuko\" (witnesses) in the ergative case, indicating they are performing the action of the verb \"salatu\" (reported), which is another clause modifying the main verb.\n- Punctuation marks (\",\", \".\") are placed according to their dependencies.\n\nThus, integrating all these elements while maintaining the syntactic structure of Basque, the sentence can be reconstructed as:\n\n**\"Indonesiako segurtasun indarrek ez dute ezer egin paramilitarrak geldiarazteko, lekukook salatu dute.\"**\n\nIn JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Indonesiako segurtasun indarrek ez dute ezer egin paramilitarrak geldiarazteko, lekukook salatu dute.\"\n}\n```"

        "output": "To reconstruct the surface form of the sentence from the given parse, we need to consider the grammatical relationships and morphological features described for each token. Here is the process:\n\n1. \"Casagrande\" modifies \"ahulezia\" (\"weakness\"), implying possession. We use the genitive case which in Basque is usually shown through the \"-ren\" suffix, resulting in \"Casagranderen ahulezia\" (Casagrande's weakness).\n2. \"une\" (moment) is modified by the determiner \"hori\" (that), so it becomes \"une hori\" (that moment).\n3. \"indar\" (strength) and \"eraso\" (attack) are linked through the conjunction \"eta\" (and), creating the phrase \"indar eta eraso\" (strength and attack).\n4. The auxiliary \"izan\" (to be) in progressive aspect and third-person plural indicates ongoing action, so it becomes \"dira\" in Basque.\n5. \"bera\" (self) modifies \"aurkari\" (enemy), and given the benefactive case and plural form, it would typically be indicated as \"aurkarientzat\" (for the enemies).\n6. The overall structure implies an equivalence or state being described by \"grina\" (enthusiasm) as the root noun, supported by the auxiliary \"izan\" linking it to the strength and attack for the enemies.\n\nCombining all these elements while respecting Basque syntax, we get the sentence:\n\n**\"Casagranderen ahulezia une hori, indar eta eraso grina dira aurkarientzat bera.\"**\n\nThus, the JSON formatted output of the original form of the sentence is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Casagranderen ahulezia une hori, indar eta eraso grina dira aurkarientzat bera.\"\n}\n```"

        "output": "To determine the surface form of the Basque sentence based on the provided linguistic features, we need to account for the syntactic and morphological structures specific to the Basque language. Here's how we can piece together the sentence:\n\n1. **etorkizun** - \"future\" in English. As a noun in the dative case, it will take a form marking dative, typically \"-ri\" or \"-(r)entzat\" in Basque.\n2. **ere** - This is a coordinating conjunction and would be used as \"even\" or \"also\" in this context. It modifies the main verb \"ukan\".\n3. **kementsu** - An adjective meaning \"strong\". Since it's absolutive and modifies the verb \"ekin\", it might remain in its basic form.\n4. **ekin** - This is a participle form of a verb (often related to \"to do\" or \"to make\"), implying an ongoing action in this construction.\n5. **nahi** - \"desire\" or \"want\" as a noun. It forms a compound with the main verb, indicating what is desired.\n6. **ukan** - The main verb, meaning \"to have\" or \"to hold\". In Basque, verbs conjugate for agreement with subjects and objects and indicate tense/mood.\n7. **.** - Punctuation ending the sentence.\n\nConsidering the dependencies:\n- \"etorkizun\" (dative noun) serves as the indirect object of \"ukan\".\n- \"kementsu\" (adjective) and \"ekin\" (participle verb) are linked, with \"kementsu\" modifying \"ekin\".\n- \"nahi\" forms a compound with \"ukan\", indicating the desire in the action.\n- \"ere\" modifies \"ukan\", giving it a sense of emphasis or continuation.\n\nThe sentence might be structured as:\n- \"Etorkizunari ere kementsu ekin nahi izan du.\"\n\nIn this translation:\n- \"Etorkizunari\" is \"etorkizun\" with the dative suffix.\n- \"ere\" follows \"etorkizunari\" to emphasize the continuity or addition.\n- \"kementsu ekin\" is a strong, ongoing action.\n- \"nahi izan du\" combines \"want\" with the auxiliary \"izan\" (to be) and \"du\" (has), indicating a desire or intention.\n\nThus, the JSON-formatted response is:\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Etorkizunari ere kementsu ekin nahi izan du.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To reconstruct the sentence from the given parse, we need to consider the morphological and syntactic information provided for each token and their dependency relations. We'll follow the structure of the sentence as dictated by the lemmas, parts of speech, dependencies, and additional morphological features such as case, number, and definiteness.\n\nHere's the breakdown of how the sentence might be constructed based on the token details:\n\n1. **\"unitate\"** - Noun, inessive case: should be modified to reflect its case, typically ending in \"-an\" for inessive in Basque.\n2. **\"_\"** - Adposition: This token is a placeholder for a grammatical marker that typically attaches directly to the noun, in this case indicating inessive case.\n3. **\",\"** - Punctuation.\n4. **\"material\"** - Noun, ergative case, plural: typically marked in Basque with \"-ek\" for plural ergative.\n5. **\"jasan\"** - Verb, imperfect aspect, infinitive: \"jasan\" is the infinitive form.\n6. **\"*edun\"** - Auxiliary verb, indicative mood, agreeing in number and person with both absolutive and ergative arguments: appears with the verb to form a compound tense or mood.\n7. **\"aldaketa\"** - Noun: \"change\".\n8. **\"fisiko\"** - Adjective modifying \"aldaketa\".\n9. **\"batzuk\"** - Determiner, absolutive case, plural, definite: this determiner specifies \"some\" or \"several\", modifying \"aldaketa fisiko\" in plural form.\n10. **\"aztertu\"** - Verb, participle, verbal adjective: this is the main verb of the sentence, usually a participle form when combined with an auxiliary.\n11. **\"izan\"** - Verb, perfect aspect, participle, verbal adjective: functions as an auxiliary to \"aztertu\".\n12. **\"*edun\"** - Auxiliary verb, indicating plural ergative argument, first person: this auxiliary helps form a specific tense or voice in the sentence, indicating a first-person plural subject.\n13. **\":\"** - Punctuation.\n\nGiven the dependencies and the parts of speech, here's an attempt to reconstruct the Basque sentence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Unitatean, materialek jasan edun aldaketa fisiko batzuk aztertu izan ditugu:\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- \"Unitatean\" suggests the noun \"unitate\" in inessive case.\n- The comma indicates a break or a subordinate clause.\n- \"materialek\" reflects \"material\" in the ergative case and plural form.\n- \"jasan edun\" combines the verb \"jasan\" with its auxiliary \"*edun\".\n- \"aldaketa fisiko batzuk\" is the direct object phrase \"some physical changes\".\n- \"aztertu izan ditugu\" combines \"aztertu\" (participle) with \"izan\" (auxiliary, perfect aspect) and \"edun\" (auxiliary, plural ergative, first person). \"ditugu\" is derived from \"*edun\" to indicate first-person plural ergative.\n- The colon might suggest that the sentence continues or introduces a list/example/details.\n\nThis reconstruction aims to respect the syntactic and morphological properties of Basque as provided in the tokens."

        "output": "To reconstruct the surface form of the Basque sentence from the provided lemmas, parts of speech, and dependency relations, we need to carefully arrange the tokens according to their dependencies and morphological features. Here's the detailed analysis and arrangement:\n\n1. **Marka** (noun, absolutive, definite, singular) depends on **prestatu** (verb, instrumental/instructive, definite, singular) as a direct object.\n2. **Prestatu** (verb) depends on **egin** (verb, root of the sentence) as an adverbial clause modifier.\n3. **Gain** (noun, absolutive, indefinite) also depends on **prestatu** as an adverbial clause modifier.\n4. **,** (punctuation) follows **prestatu**.\n5. **Zer** (determiner) depends on **jardun** (verb, participle, verbal adjective).\n6. **Jardun** (verb, absolutive, indefinite, participle, verbal adjective) depends on **egin** as a direct object.\n7. **Egin** (verb, perfect aspect, participle) is the root token.\n8. **Edun** (auxiliary, indicative/realis, agreements in number and person with absolutive and ergative) depends on **egin** as an auxiliary.\n9. **Harri** (noun) depends on **egin** as an oblique nominal.\n10. **Handi** (adjective, comitative/associative, definite, plural) modifies **harri**.\n11. **?** (punctuation) follows the root verb **egin**.\n\nGiven these dependencies and characteristics, the sentence in Basque likely follows the syntax where the clauses linked by the verbs are placed near each other, and modifiers directly precede or follow their head nouns or verbs. Based on these conventions, the sentence could be structured as follows:\n\n**\"Marka prestatu gain, zer jardun egin edun harri handiekin?\"**\n\nThis sentence translates the individual components into a cohesive question, arranging the clauses and modifiers as per the dependencies and typical Basque syntax. Adjustments might be needed for exact word forms due to morphological changes in verbs or nouns not specified in the provided details. Here's the JSON formatted response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Marka prestatu gain, zer jardun egin edun harri handiekin?\"\n}\n```"

The main verb \"hautsi\" is a participle indicating a perfect aspect and is the root of the sentence. This verb is accompanied by an auxiliary \"*edun,\" which matches the verb in mood, number, and person agreements.\n\nThe direct object of \"hautsi\" is \"lasaitasun,\" which is a singular, definite noun in the absolutive case. The nominal subject of \"hautsi\" is \"etorrera,\" which is in the ergative case, singular, and definite. This noun is modified by \"kide\" in the genitive case, which itself is modified by the numeral \"3.000\" indicating a quantity, and further modified by the noun phrase \"Lashkar Jihad talde musulman,\" where \"Lashkar Jihad\" form a proper noun combination, and \"musulman\" is an adjective modifying \"talde.\"\n\nThe sentence is punctuated by a period at the end.\n\nThus, the surface form of the sentence can be presented as:\n\n**\"Baina lasaitasun hautsi du Lashkar Jihad musulman taldeko 3.000 kiden etorrerak.\"**\n\nThis sentence can be translated as \"But the arrival of 3,000 members of the Muslim group Lashkar Jihad has disturbed the peace.\"\n\nHere is the response in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Baina lasaitasun hautsi du Lashkar Jihad musulman taldeko 3.000 kiden etorrerak.\"\n}\n```"

        "output": "To reconstruct the sentence from the provided token analysis, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The 1st token \"gu\" is a personal pronoun and acts as a nominal modifier for the 2nd token \"lan\".\n2. The 2nd token \"lan\" is a noun in the absolutive case and singular number, and it serves as the nominal subject for the 3rd token \"dohain\".\n3. The 3rd token \"dohain\" is the root of the sentence, also a noun in the absolutive case and singular number.\n4. The 4th token \"izan\" is an auxiliary verb in the progressive aspect and indicative mood, serving as a copula linking to the 3rd token \"dohain\".\n5. The 5th token is a punctuation mark.\n\nIn Basque, the pronoun \"gu\" (we) typically modifies a noun phrase to express possession or relation, like \"our\". Given the structure, \"gu\" modifies \"lan\" to form a phrase meaning \"our work\". The root \"dohain\" suggests a noun with a meaning related to a gift or talent, and \"izan\" in the progressive aspect could translate to \"is being\".\n\nConsidering Basque syntax and morphology, the sentence could be:\n\n**\"Gure lana dohain izaten da.\"**\n\nHere, \"gure\" is the possessive form of \"gu\" (our), \"lana\" is the definite form of \"lan\" (work), \"dohain\" is in its root form, and \"izaten da\" reflects the progressive aspect of \"izan\".\n\nThus, the surface form in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Gure lana dohain izaten da.\"}\n```"

The verb \"ukan\" appears with \"du\" to agree with the singular ergative argument. \"Eta\" is used to coordinate \"egoera\" and \"ahulezia\".\n\nTherefore, the JSON formatted answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Gorri-berdeko gobernua alde Europa egoera onean eta euro ahulezian ukan du.\"}\n```"

        "output": "Given the detailed linguistic features and dependencies of each token, we can reconstruct the sentence in Basque. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Galdetu** - This is the root verb in a participle form with a perfect aspect. It forms the main clause of the sentence.\n2. **Bestela** - As a coordinating conjunction, it modifies \"galdetu\" as an adverbial modifier. This suggests it introduces a conditional or alternative scenario.\n3. **Plaza** - A noun in the inessive case (indicating location, \"in the plaza\"), definite and singular. It is part of a subordinate clause describing where the action of the verb \"ibili\" (to walk) occurs.\n4. **Ibili** - A verb in a subjunctive mood with a progressive aspect, indicating a continuing or habitual action. It is modified by \"plaza\" and forms a subordinate clause indicating the action taking place.\n5. **Neska-mutil** - A plural noun in the dative case (\"to/for boys and girls\"), definite. It serves as the indirect object to \"galdetu\", indicating to whom the action pertains.\n6. **.** - Punctuation marking the end of the sentence.\n\nCombining these into a coherent Basque sentence, considering typical Basque syntax (SOV - Subject Object Verb) and the provided grammatical roles:\n\n- **Galdetu** is the main verb.\n- **Neska-mutilei** is the dative plural form of \"neska-mutil\" (to/for the boys and girls).\n- **Bestela** introduces or modifies the main clause.\n- **Plazan ibiltzen** combines \"plaza\" (in the plaza) with \"ibili\" (walking) in a subjunctive and progressive form, describing an ongoing or potential action.\n\nThus, the reconstructed sentence in Basque might look like this:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Neska-mutilei galdetu bestela plazan ibiltzen.\"}\n```\n\nThis translates roughly to \"Ask the boys and girls otherwise walking in the plaza.\" This sentence assumes a context where the action of asking might be contingent on the ongoing action of walking in the plaza."

Here's a breakdown of how the sentence structure emerges from the data:\n\n- The root verb \"izan\" (to be) in the 10th position suggests the main clause.\n- The auxiliary verbs \"izan\" follow their respective main verbs to agree in number and person.\n- The oblique nominal relations and case markings help in arranging modifiers and nominal phrases around their heads.\n\nGiven the dependencies and parts of speech, the reconstructed sentence could be:\n\n\"Etxean hil izan diren landareak %90 gehiegi ureztatu izan dira.\"\n\nThis translates the sentence's components as follows:\n- \"Etxean\" (in the house) is formed by the noun \"etxe\" (house) with the inessive case postposition \"barru\" indicating location.\n- \"hil izan diren\" (that have died) combines the verb \"hil\" (to die) in its infinitive form, modified by the auxiliary \"izan\" (to be) to form a past participle, and the auxiliary \"dire\" for plural third-person indicative.\n- \"landareak\" (the plants) is the noun \"landare\" in plural with a definite article ending.\n- \"%90 gehiegi\" (too much by 90%) where \"%90\" is a cardinal number and \"gehiegi\" as a modifier suggesting excess.\n- \"ureztatu izan dira\" (have been watered too much) where \"ureztatu\" is a causative verb meaning to water, followed by the auxiliary \"izan\" and \"dira\" for third-person plural indicative.\n\nThus, the English translation would be, \"The plants that have died in the house have been watered too much by 90%.\"\n\nLet's format the original Basque sentence as requested in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Etxean hil izan diren landareak %90 gehiegi ureztatu izan dira.\"\n}\n```"

In Basque, the ergative plural is typically marked by the suffix \"-ek\". Thus, the surface form of \"argazkilari\" in this context would be \"argazkilariek\".\n\n2. **Token 2**: \"esan\" is a verb in the indicative mood, progressive aspect, with agreement in number and person with a singular absolutive argument and plural ergative argument. The verb itself would likely appear in its base form as the main conjugation and mood/aspect handling is reflected in auxiliary verbs in Basque, which are not specified here.\n\n3. **Token 3**: \":\" is a punctuation mark used as given.\n\nPutting these together, the surface form of the sentence would be structured as follows:\n\n**\"Argazkilariek esan:\"**\n\nThis structure indicates that the noun \"argazkilari\" in its ergative plural form acts as the subject for the verb \"esan\", and the sentence ends with a colon, possibly introducing a quotation or continuation.\n\nHence the JSON response for the original form of the sentence would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Argazkilariek esan:\"}\n```"

Here is the breakdown and analysis:\n\n1. **\"ahal baldin ukan\"** - This phrase likely forms a conditional clause. \"Baldin\" is a coordinating conjunction that typically introduces a condition, modifying \"ahal\" (ability), and \"ukan\" (to have) is an auxiliary that supports this structure.\n2. **\"beste ezusteko bat eman\"** - \"Beste\" (another) modifies \"ezusteko\" (surprise), and \"bat\" (one) is a numeric modifier to \"ezusteko,\" forming the phrase \"another surprise.\" \"Eman\" (give) is the main verb related to this noun phrase.\n3. **\"saiatu izan\"** - \"Saiatu\" (try) is the main verb in prospective aspect, and \"izan\" is an auxiliary in plural form aligning with \"saiatu,\" indicating \"we tried.\"\n4. **\"zail izan izan\"** - \"Zail\" (difficult) is an adjective describing a state. The first \"izan\" acts as a copula linking \"zail,\" and the second \"izan\" is an auxiliary indicating the tense and mood.\n5. **\"jakin arren\"** - \"Jakin\" (know) is a verb in participle form, modified by \"arren\" (although), creating a clause that translates to \"although known\" or \"even knowing.\"\n6. Punctuation - The period (\".\") marks the end of the sentence.\n\nCombining these elements based on the dependencies and typical Basque sentence structure, the sentence would be:\n\n**\"Ahal baldin badugu, beste ezusteko bat eman saiatu gara, zaila izan dela jakin arren.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"If we can, we tried to give another surprise, knowing that it has been difficult.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON representation of the original form is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Ahal baldin badugu, beste ezusteko bat eman saiatu gara, zaila izan dela jakin arren.\"\n}\n```"

The main verb (\"aldarrikatu\") is the root and is modified by an auxiliary (\"*edun\") indicating the tense and agreement features.\n2. The subject (\"bretoi\", modified by \"korsikar\" and \"euskaldun\") is a complex noun phrase including a conjunction (\"eta\").\n3. The direct object or the complement of the verb (\"herriratu\") is modified by a genitive plural noun (\"preso\") and a numeral (\"bat\").\n4. The sentence includes punctuation marks (\",\", \".\") that separate and properly terminate the sentence.\n\nGiven the grammatical relationships and typical Basque syntax, we can predict the sentence structure. Basque is an ergative-absolutive language, meaning the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are marked the same (absolutive), and the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently (ergative).\n\nThus, the sentence structure should be approximately:\n\n\"Bretoi, korsikar eta euskaldunek presoen herriratu bat aldarrikatu dute.\"\n\nThis translates the elements as follows:\n\n- \"Bretoi, korsikar eta euskaldun\" as a coordinated noun phrase in the ergative case, representing the subjects \"the Breton, Corsican, and Basque people\".\n- \"ek\" as the ergative plural marker.\n- \"presoen\" as the genitive plural of \"preso\" meaning \"of the prisoners\".\n- \"herriratu bat\" as \"a repatriation\".\n- \"aldarrikatu\" as the main verb \"claimed\" or \"demanded\".\n- \"*edun\" as the auxiliary \"dute\" showing plural third person ergative agreement.\n- Commas and period for punctuation as specified.\n\nHere is the response in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Bretoi, korsikar eta euskaldunek presoen herriratu bat aldarrikatu dute.\"}\n```"

Here's how we can derive the sentence:\n\n1. **Etiketa** - Noun, ergative case, definite, singular. It's the subject of the verb (token 5).\n2. **Portu** - Noun, acts as the base for the next modifier (token 3).\n3. **Bakoitz** - Adjective, genitive case, definite, singular, modifies \"portu\" to specify each port.\n4. **Izen** - Noun, absolutive case, definite, singular, is the direct object of the verb (token 5), modified by \"portu bakoitz\" indicating \"each port's name.\"\n5. **Izan** - Verb, prospective aspect, participle form, root of the sentence.\n6. **Edun** - Auxiliary, conditional mood, matches the agreements of both absolutive and ergative arguments, indicating a conditional aspect.\n7. **.** - Punctuation, ends the sentence.\n\nGiven the details:\n- \"Etiketa\" (ergative case) suggests the agent performing the action.\n- \"Izan\" as a participle verb in prospective aspect combined with the conditional auxiliary \"edun\" suggests a conditional or potential aspect to the sentence.\n- The genitive case on \"bakoitz\" attached to \"portu\" forms a phrase meaning \"each port's.\"\n- Thus, the direct object \"izen\" would be \"the name of each port.\"\n\nConsidering Basque syntax, where the ergative subject typically follows the auxiliary, and the direct object precedes the verb, the sentence might be structured as:\n\n**\"Portu bakoitzaren izena etiketak izango luke.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"The label would have the name of each port,\" reflecting the ergative subject (\"etiketa\"), the direct object (\"portu bakoitzaren izena\"), and the conditional construction with the participle and auxiliary verb (\"izango luke\").\n\nTherefore, the JSON representation of the sentence is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Portu bakoitzaren izena etiketak izango luke.\"}\n```"

Here are some key considerations:\n\n1. **Opening and closing punctuation marks** are placed at the beginning and end of the sentence, respectively.\n2. **\"Talde publiko izatea\"** is crafted from the tokens \"talde\" (noun), \"publiko\" (adjective modifying \"talde\"), and \"izan\" (auxiliary in infinitive form, functioning as a copula here). The noun phrase \"talde publiko\" translates as \"public team\" and \"izatea\" converts it to the infinitive form \"to be\".\n3. **Commas** are used to separate elements within the sentence, indicating pauses or shifts in the sentence structure.\n4. **\"guk irizpide batzuk jarraitu ditugu\"** is created by combining \"gu\" (pronoun), \"irizpide\" (noun, pluralized with \"batzuk\"), \"jarraitu\" (verb in participle form), and \"*edun\" (auxiliary verb conjugated to match the subject and objects). It translates to \"we have followed some criteria\".\n5. **\"lan hau aukeratzean\"** links \"lan\" (noun), \"hau\" (determiner), and \"aukera+tze\" (noun in inessive case, indicating the action of choosing in this context).\n6. **Conjunction \"eta\"** connects two parts of the sentence.\n7. **\"irizpide hori giza konpromisoa izan da\"** connects \"irizpide\" (noun), \"hori\" (determiner), \"giza\" (noun), \"konpromiso\" (noun), and \"izan\" (auxiliary) in a clause that translates to \"and that criterion has been a human commitment\".\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the original form:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"\\\"Talde publiko izatea, guk irizpide batzuk jarraitu ditugu lan hau aukeratzean eta irizpide hori giza konpromisoa izan da\\\".\"\n}\n```"

Each part of speech and morphological feature will help in forming the correct phrase in Basque.\n\nHere are the step-by-step deductions for each token:\n- The **4th token** is the root, a verb \"mintzatu\" with perfect aspect and verbal adjective form. Thus, \"mintzatu\" is likely modified to reflect its aspect and function, typically forming a past participle.\n- The **5th token** is an auxiliary verb \"izan,\" indicating a past tense with first person plural conjugation, translating to \"we have been.\"\n- The **2nd token** is a noun \"gai,\" and it serves as an oblique nominal dependent on the verb \"mintzatu.\"\n- The **3rd token** is a determiner \"guzti,\" which modifies \"gai,\" indicating a definite and plural number, likely meaning \"all\" or \"every\" in the context of the noun it modifies. This would be attached to \"gai\" to form \"gai guzti\" (all matters/topics).\n- The **1st** and **6th tokens** are punctuation marks, framing the sentence.\n\nCombining these elements, the likely sentence structure in Basque, considering the dependencies and features, would be:\n\n\"Gai guztietaz mintzatu gara.\"\n\nThis sentence translates to \"We have talked about all matters.\" Now, let's format this into the requested JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Gai guztietaz mintzatu gara.\"}\n```"

        "output": "To construct the original sentence form from the detailed token dependencies and morphological features, we need to correctly align each token based on its grammatical function, dependency, and the Basque language's syntactic rules. Here’s an analysis and reconstruction of the sentence:\n\n1. The phrase \"herri Batasuna\" appears to be a compound name, possibly \"Herri Batasuna\" with \"Herri\" modifying \"Batasuna\".\n2. \"mahai nazional\" translates to \"national table\", where \"nazional\" is an adjective modifying \"mahai\".\n3. \"espetxeratu\" is a verb in the participle form, modified by \"edun\" (an auxiliary).\n4. \"Carlos Iturgaitz PP\" describes a person named Carlos Iturgaitz associated with the \"PP\" (a political party or similar), forming a complex proper noun.\n5. \"buru\" serves as the subject in the ergative case, indicating the agent of the action, in this case, Carlos Iturgaitz.\n6. The sentence \"egin edun ordaindu edun\" nested within quotes, seems to be a quoted statement, indicating something Carlos Iturgaitz had done or ordered.\n7. \"esaldi\" is a noun serving as the object of the verb \"esan\", meaning \"said\".\n8. \"esan\" is the main verb in the sentence, in the participle form, supported by the auxiliary \"edun\".\n9. The overall sentence structure involves a complex interaction of a main clause about Carlos Iturgaitz saying something, and a nested clause describing what was said.\n\nBased on this analysis, a plausible reconstruction of the sentence might look like this:\n\n**\"Herri Batasunaren mahai nazionala espetxeratuak edun Carlos Iturgaitz PPren buruak 'egin beharreko ordaindu beharreko esaldia' esan du.\"**\n\nThis sentence translates roughly to \"The head of the PP, Carlos Iturgaitz, from the national table of Herri Batasuna, who has been imprisoned, said 'the sentence that must be done, must be paid'.\"\n\nThis is an educated guess based on the grammatical and dependency information provided. The actual sentence could vary, especially with potential nuances in the Basque language's syntax and morphology.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Herri Batasunaren mahai nazionala espetxeratuak edun Carlos Iturgaitz PPren buruak 'egin beharreko ordaindu beharreko esaldia' esan du.\"\n}\n```"

        "output": "To reconstruct the sentence from the given parse, we should follow the dependency relations and morphosyntactic information provided for each token. Here's how the sentence structure emerges based on the dependencies and features:\n\n1. **Retegi** is a proper noun in the ergative case and is the subject for the verb at token 10.\n2. **\",\"** and **\",\"** (tokens 2 and 5) are punctuations associated with token 8 and denote separation in the list or structure of the sentence.\n3. **berragerpen** (token 3) is a noun in the inessive case and is modified by **bezala** (token 4), which acts as a case marker, indicating a comparison or manner (\"like a recovery\").\n4. **Oier** (token 6) is a proper noun and part of a compound that completes at token 7, **zehar** (a noun in the absolutive case), likely forming a phrase akin to \"through Oier\" or \"Oier through\".\n5. **izan** (token 8) is an auxiliary verb in the perfect aspect and serves as a copula here. It is modified by the auxiliary **edun** (token 9) for tense, mood, and agreement.\n6. **bikote** (token 10) is the main noun (root) of the sentence in the absolutive case and indefinite, likely meaning \"a pair\" or \"couple\".\n7. **\".\"** (token 11) is the ending punctuation.\n\nThe ergative case in Basque typically marks the subject of a transitive verb, while the absolutive is used for the object or the subject of an intransitive verb. Given this and the dependencies specified:\n\n1. \"Retegi\" acts as the agent performing the action.\n2. \"berragerpen bezala\" and \"Oier zehar\" describe the manner or context of the action related to the main verb \"izan\".\n3. The copula \"izan\" links to \"bikote\", which is described further by the preceding phrases and \"edun\".\n\nPutting this together, the sentence structure might be:\n\n**Retegi, berragerpen bezala, Oier zehar, bikote izan zen.**\n\nThis translates to: \"Retegi, like a recovery, through Oier, has been a couple.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON format answer is:\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Retegi, berragerpen bezala, Oier zehar, bikote izan zen.\"}\n```"

In Basque, locative modifiers typically follow the noun they modify, often with a postpositional suffix indicating locative case, which in this context would typically be \"-ko\" to form \"jardunaldiko.\"\n2. \"ezusteko\" is the nominal subject of the main verb \"egon\" and is in the absolutive case.\n3. Commas and the colon are used as punctuation around conjunctions and at the end of the sentence.\n4. \"baina\" is a coordinating conjunction that connects clauses.\n5. \"emakume\" (noun, inessive, definite, plural) acts as an oblique nominal in the plural inessive case. The inessive case in Basque is typically marked by \"-etan\" indicating location in or at, forming \"emakumeetan.\"\n6. \"egon\" is the main verb in its participle form, indicating a perfect aspect.\n7. \"izan\" is an auxiliary verb in the indicative mood, agreeing in number and person with the absolutive argument, which is singular third person.\n\nConsolidating all these details, the surface structure of the sentence in Basque would be:\n\n**Jardunaldiko ezusteko, baina emakumeetan egon izan da:**\n\nWriting this in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Jardunaldiko ezusteko, baina emakumeetan egon izan da:\"}\n```"

        "output": "Based on the detailed linguistic features provided for each token in the Basque sentence and the dependencies and grammatical relationships outlined, we can reconstruct the original surface form of the sentence. Here's the step-by-step reconstruction:\n\n1. The root verb \"hil\" (to kill) is completed with its auxiliary \"*edun\" to form the perfect aspect, \"hildako\" or similar, meaning \"have killed.\"\n2. \"IRA\" as the subject in the ergative case.\n3. The phrase formed around the verb includes direct objects and oblique nominals:\n   - \"beste bost militar britainiar\" (another five British soldiers) as the direct object.\n   - \"urte horretan\" (in that year) as an oblique nominal.\n   - \"inguru\" (around) modifies \"hildako\" indicating the location.\n4. A conjunction \"eta\" (and) introduces a second clause or related action.\n5. \"deitu\" (to call) modified by \"*edun\" forms another verb phrase, likely meaning something akin to \"has been called.\"\n6. \"mandil\" and \"eskualde\" form a genitive relationship modifying \"eskualde\" to describe the region, likely \"mandilen eskualde\" (the region of the aprons).\n7. \"Armagh inguru horretan\" specifies the location for the second verb action.\n8. Punctuation marks like commas and quotation marks are placed around \"mandilen eskualde\" to indicate quoted speech or emphasis.\n\nBased on these reconstructions, the sentence in Basque likely reads:\n\n\"IRAk urte horretan beste bost militar britainiar hildako ditu inguruan, eta horregatik, \\\"mandilen eskualde\\\" deitu izan du Armagh inguru horretan.\"\n\nIn JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"IRAk urte horretan beste bost militar britainiar hildako ditu inguruan, eta horregatik, \\\"mandilen eskualde\\\" deitu izan du Armagh inguru horretan.\"\n}\n```"

Here's a breakdown of how the tokens relate to each other and how they would typically appear in a Basque sentence:\n\n1. **\"Hitzaurre\"** (noun, locative, definite, singular) modifies **\"neska\"** (nominal modifier relationship), suggesting a locative relation like \"in the introduction\".\n2. **\"Neska\"** (noun) is the nominal subject of the verb **\"bihurtu\"**.\n3. **\"Atzeratu\"** (verb, participle) modifies **\"neska\"**, suggesting the girl is \"delayed\".\n4. **\"Hamasei\"** (numeral, cardinal) and **\"hogei\"** (numeral, cardinal) with **\"edo\"** (coordinating conjunction) forming a number range \"sixteen or twenty\".\n5. **\"Urte\"** (noun, inanimate) modified by **\"hamasei edo hogei\"**, making \"sixteen or twenty years\".\n6. **\"Neskatila\"** (noun, absolutive, definite, singular) is the subject of the subordinate clause indicating \"a girl\".\n7. **\"Oso\"** (adverb) modifies **\"polit\"** (adjective), together modifying **\"neskatila\"**, so \"a very polite girl\".\n8. **\"Bihurtu\"** (verb, perfect aspect, participle) is the main verb, with **\"izan\"** (auxiliary, indicative, singular third person) as its auxiliary.\n9. **\".\"** (punctuation) marks the end of the sentence.\n\nThus, the sentence structure would be along the lines of \"[The girl in the delayed introduction] has become [a very polite girl of sixteen or twenty years].\"\n\nHowever, due to the complexity of Basque grammar and the challenge of translating morphological and syntactic information directly into a coherent sentence without additional context or native fluency, the translation provided here is somewhat speculative. It respects the dependency relationships and attempts to use Basque syntactic norms.\n\nHere is a possible constructed sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Hitzaurreko atzeratutako neskak hamasei edo hogei urteko neskatila oso polit bihurtu izan da.\"}\n\nThis sentence translates the elements as follows:\n- **\"Hitzaurreko atzeratutako neskak\"** - \"The girl in the delayed introduction\"\n- **\"hamasei edo hogei urteko neskatila\"** - \"a girl of sixteen or twenty years\"\n- **\"oso polit\"** - \"very polite\"\n- **\"bihurtu izan da\"** - \"has become\""

        "output": "The construction of the sentence based on the provided linguistic features involves understanding the relationships among the tokens and their dependencies, as well as the grammatical rules of the Basque language. Here is how the tokens are structured and related:\n\n1. \"PAN\" is a proper noun in locative case, modifying \"buru\".\n2. \"buru\" is a noun in ergative case, acting as the subject of \"jarraitu\".\n3. \"jarraitu\" is a verb modified by \"*edun\" (auxiliary), and it serves as a clausal modifier for \"politika\".\n4. \"*edun\" is an auxiliary verb supporting \"jarraitu\".\n5. \"politika\" is a noun in absolutive case, which is the direct object of \"kritikatu\".\n6. \"kritikatu\" is a verb supported by another \"*edun\" (auxiliary), and it is the subject of the main verb \"egon\".\n7. Another \"*edun\" is an auxiliary verb supporting \"kritikatu\".\n8. \"ere\" acts as an adverbial modifier for \"kritikatu\".\n9. \"egon\" is the main verb in the sentence.\n10. \",\" is punctuation which depends on \"jarraitu\".\n11. \"ordea\" is a coordinating conjunction modifying \"egon\".\n12. \".\" is punctuation marking the end of the sentence.\n\nConsidering the dependencies and the roles of each token, the sentence can be constructed as follows:\n\n**PANeko buruak jarraituko duen politika kritikatua ere egon da, ordea.**\n\nThis sentence translates roughly to \"The policy that will be followed by the head of the PAN has also been criticized, however.\"\n\nThus, the JSON representation of the original form of the sentence is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"PANeko buruak jarraituko duen politika kritikatua ere egon da, ordea.\"}\n```"

In Basque, plural definite nouns often use the suffix -ak, resulting in \"zuloak.\"\n2. **Ahal** - Noun, partitive case, indefinite state: This typically indicates some potential or ability; in Basque, partitive case is often marked with the suffix -ik, resulting in \"ahalik.\"\n3. **Eta** - Coordinating conjunction: This conjunction \"eta\" usually means \"and\" but here seems to be part of a fixed expression with \"ahal.\"\n4. **Txiki** - Adjective, absolutive case, definite state, superlative degree, plural number: Since \"txiki\" means \"small,\" and it is in the superlative degree, it would be \"txikienak\" for the \"smallest\" in plural definite form.\n5. **Izan** - Auxiliary verb, in infinitive form: This suggests an infinitive usage of \"to be,\" which is \"izan.\"\n6. **Edin** - Auxiliary verb, subjunctive mood, plural agreement: This verb form suggests a subjunctive or potential mood, likely \"edin\" (though the asterisk before \"edin\" suggests it might be a special or irregular form).\n7. **.** - Punctuation, marking the end of the sentence.\n\nCombining these elements, the sentence likely translates to \"Zuloak ahalik eta txikienak izan edin.\" in Basque, meaning \"May the holes be as small as possible.\"\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Zuloak ahalik eta txikienak izan edin.\"}\n```"

The auxiliary \"izan\" in the second person suggests the meaning related to \"you are losing\".\n- The sentence structure implies an exclamatory form due to the presence of \"!\".\n\nConsidering the morphology and syntax, the most likely surface form of the sentence in Basque, reflecting the progressive aspect and the exclamatory tone, is:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Galdatzen ari zara!\"}\n\nThis translation considers \"galdu\" as a base for a progressive form (\"galdatzen\"), with \"ari zara\" as a common Basque construction for progressive aspect auxiliary verbs in the second person."

The grammatical clues such as case, number, and dependency relations help determine the proper arrangement and conjugation of the words.\n\nHere's how the sentence structure can be determined from the provided linguistic features:\n\n- The 1st token \"EEBB\" is a proper noun in the locative case and acts as a modifier for the 2nd token \"musika\", which means it could be something like \"Ameriketatik\" (from the USA), adapting the lemma \"EEBB\" to fit the locative case in Basque.\n- The 2nd token \"musika\" is a noun in the ergative case, indicating that it is the doer of the action.\n- The 3rd token \"ere\" is a coordinating conjunction, adding an adverbial nuance like \"even\".\n- The 4th token \"lagundu\" is the root of the sentence and is a verb.\n- The 5th and 6th tokens (\"egin\" and \"*edun\") are both auxiliary verbs that support the main verb \"lagundu\". The verb \"lagundu\" must be in a participle form because it is a verbal adjective, and \"egin\" is another participle verb. The auxiliary \"*edun\" (a form of \"izan\" or \"eduki\" likely misspelled) indicates a perfective aspect and agreement with both subjects (singular ergative and singular absolutive).\n- Finally, the 7th token is punctuation.\n\nConsidering these details, the sentence in Basque would likely be structured as:\n\n**\"Ameriketatik musikak ere lagundu egin du.\"**\n\n- \"Ameriketatik\" represents \"from the USA\" fitting the locative case of \"EEBB\".\n- \"musikak\" is \"music\" in the ergative case, indicating it as the subject performing the action.\n- \"ere\" is \"even\", linking to the verb.\n- \"lagundu egin du\" is a common construction in Basque where \"lagundu\" (helped) is modified by the participle \"egin\" (done/made) and the auxiliary \"du\" (has), fitting the verb form and agreement detailed.\n\nThus, the JSON format of the sentence would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Ameriketatik musikak ere lagundu egin du.\"}\n```"
