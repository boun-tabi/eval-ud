The \"kent\" (city) and \"ki\" form a compound noun in the locative case, which will be \"kentteki\" (in the city).\n4. \"İş\" is a noun in the accusative case, which would simply be \"işi\" (the job) as the accusative case is often marked by the suffix -i.\n5. \"Bit\" is a verb in the form of a converb, which means it will take a suffix to indicate this form, and since \"de\" is an emphasizing word/intensifier associated with it, the combined form will be \"bitirip de\" (having finished and also).\n6. \"De\" has been addressed in point 5.\n7. \"Kasaba\" is in the dative case, which will be \"kasabaya\" (to the town).\n8. \"Dön\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, past tense, and as a participle, which will be \"dönmüş\" (having turned/returned).\n9. \"Zaman\" as an adverb will likely be \"zamanında\" (on time/at the time).\n10. \"El\" is a possessive noun which will be \"eli\" (his/her/its hand).\n11. \"Boş\" is a noun here, which is a bit unusual since it's typically an adjective, but as the root of the sentence, it would be \"boş\" (empty/vacant).\n12. \".\" is the punctuation to end the sentence.\n\nCombining all of the above, we get the sentence:\n\n\"Fakat kentteki işi bitirip de kasabaya dönmüş zamanında eli boş.\"\n\nNow, let's format this in JSON as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Fakat kentteki işi bitirip de kasabaya dönmüş zamanında eli boş.\"}\n```"

The surface forms of the tokens need to reflect the information provided, such as case, number, person, tense, mood, and whether it is negated or not. Additionally, the sentence structure must follow the dependency relations indicated for each token.\n\nLet's construct the sentence step by step:\n\n- The 1st token \"o\" is a third-person singular pronoun in the nominative case and is the subject of the verb.\n- The 2nd token \"hangi\" is a determiner for the 3rd token.\n- The 3rd token \"iş\" is a singular noun in the instrumental case and serves as an oblique argument or adjunct to the 4th token.\n- The 4th token \"meşgul\" is a singular noun in the nominative case and is modified by an adverbial clause.\n- The 5th and 6th tokens make up a single word that is a light verb construction with a conditional auxiliary verb, which should be \"olsa\".\n- The 7th token \"ol\" is a verb in the imperative mood, positive, and singular, and part of reduplicated compounds, which suggests repetition or emphasis in Turkish, typically seen in the form \"olsa ol\".\n- The 8th token \"son\" is an adverb modifying the 9th token.\n- The 9th token \"derece\" is a singular noun in the nominative case and is an adjectival modifier to the 10th token.\n- The 10th token \"dikkatli\" is a singular noun in the nominative case and is the root of the sentence, functioning as a predicate.\n- The 11th token is the punctuation mark \".\" and marks the end of the sentence.\n\nGiven these considerations, the original form of the sentence in Turkish would likely be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"O hangi işle meşgul olsa ol son derece dikkatli.\"}\n```\n\nThis sentence translates to \"He/She is extremely careful with whatever job he/she would be involved in.\" The surface form respects Turkish grammar rules, including verb conjugation and noun cases."

        "output": "To construct the surface form of the sentence, we will use the lemmas and their grammatical features provided for each token. Turkish is an agglutinative language where words are formed with various affixes to reflect grammatical relations. Here's how the sentence can be built:\n\n- **1st token (\"o\")**: This is a third person singular pronoun in locative case. In Turkish, the locative case can be marked by the suffix \"-da\" or \"-de\" depending on vowel harmony. Since \"o\" ends with a vowel, we'll use \"-da\" or \"-de\" based on the following vowel harmony rules.\n- **2nd token (\"ilkbahar\")**: As a noun in the dative case, it would take the suffix \"-a\" or \"-e\" for the dative case, following vowel harmony.\n- **3rd token (\"özgü\")**: This adposition will affect the form of the second token. In Turkish, it would combine with the noun and result in a compound word.\n- **4th token (\"gel\")**: This is a positive, affirmative converb, which is a non-finite verb form used adverbially. In Turkish, converbs (or adverbial participles) can be formed with the suffix \"-ince\" or \"-ince\".\n- **5th token (\"geçici\")**: An adjective modifying the converb, which typically does not change its form.\n- **6th token (\"Kasırga\")**: A plural noun in nominative case. The plural marker in Turkish is \"-lar\" or \"-ler\" depending on vowel harmony.\n- **7th token (\"çeşit\")**: A singular noun in the ablative case. The ablative case can be marked by \"-den\" or \"-dan\".\n- **8th token (\"kayna\")**: As a verbal noun, it will take a plural marker and will be the subject of the participle verb form from tokens 10 and 11.\n- **9th token (\"taş\")**: Another verbal noun which will form a compound with the 8th token.\n- **10th token (\"ol\")**: A verb in participle form. Participles in Turkish can take the suffix \"-an\" or \"-en\" for habitual aspects.\n- **11th token (\"y\")**: An auxiliary verb with evidentiality, which will combine with the 10th token to form a past tense narrative evidential verb form with the suffix \"-miş\" or \"-muş\".\n- **12th token (\".\")**: This is punctuation and will remain unchanged.\n\nConsidering all the morphological rules and the dependencies between the tokens, the sentence would be constructed as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Onda ilkbahara özgü gelince geçici Kasırgalar çeşitten kaynaklanan taşkınlar olmuş.\"}\n```\n\nPlease note that Turkish is highly sensitive to vowel harmony, and without the specific context or knowing the exact surface forms of some words, I have chosen the suffixes that are more commonly used or that fit with the general rules of vowel harmony. The actual sentence might differ slightly in terms of the specific vowels used in these suffixes."

        "output": "To reconstruct the sentence in its original surface form, we need to consider Turkish word order, morphology, and the given dependencies. Turkish is an agglutinative language, meaning that words are often formed by adding various suffixes to a base word. Let's analyze the tokens one by one to build the sentence:\n\n1. \"mutluluk\" is a noun in the instrumental case and singular. It acts as a nominal modifier to the 7th token.\n2. \"ara\" is a noun in the locative case and singular, with a plural possessive first-person marker (our). It depends on the 3rd token as an adjectival modifier.\n3. \"dur\" is a positive, present tense participle verb that modifies the 7th token as a clausal modifier of the noun.\n4. \"en\" is an adverb modifying the 5th token.\n5. \"büyük\" is an adjective modifying the 7th token.\n6. \"engel\" is a noun in the nominative case, singular, modifying the 7th token.\n7. \"kendi\" is a reflexive pronoun in the nominative case, plural, first-person possessive (ourselves), and is the subject of the sentence.\n8. \"mi\" is the question particle that modifies the 7th token. It's used to form a question in Turkish.\n9-10. \"yok\" is a negated noun (there is not), and \"y\" is an auxiliary verb forming a conditional mood, singular, third person, present tense. Together they form \"yoksa\" (if not).\n11. \"?\" punctuation for the question.\n12. \"\"\" opening quotation mark.\n13. \"500\" is a numeral modifying the 14th token.\n14. \"MGR\" is a noun in the accusative case, singular, and is the direct object of the sentence.\n15. \".\" punctuation ending the quoted sentence.\n16. \"\"\" closing quotation mark.\n17. \"de\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, first-hand evidentiality, plural, first person, positive, past tense, and is the root of the sentence.\n18. \".\" punctuation ending the sentence.\n\nWith these dependencies and morphological features, we can construct the following sentence in Turkish:\n\n`{\"original_form\": \"Mutlulukla aradığımızda en büyük engel kendimiz mi yoksa? \\\"500 MGR.\\\" demiştik.\"}`\n\nThis sentence translates to English as: \"When we search with happiness, is the biggest obstacle ourselves or not? We had said, '500 MGR.'\" (Note that \"MGR\" is kept as it is because it seems to be a proper noun or abbreviation that does not change in the accusative case.)"

        "output": "To construct the surface form of the sentence from the given tokens, we need to consider the dependencies and morphological features to determine the correct Turkish word forms and syntax.\n\nGiven the grammatical relations and features, the surface form of the sentence can be constructed as follows:\n\n- Mars (1st token) is the subject of the verb in the 4th token (aktar).\n- Enerji (2nd token) is the direct object in the accusative case and depends on the verb aktar (4th token).\n- Merkür (3rd token) is an oblique argument in the dative case and also depends on the verb aktar (4th token).\n- The verb aktar (4th token) is imperative, affirmative, and in converb form, functioning as an adverbial clause modifier to the verb güç (6th token).\n- İletişim (5th token) is the direct object in the accusative case depending on the verb güç (6th token).\n- The verb güç (6th token) is imperative, in the habitual aspect, present tense, causative voice, and functions as an adverbial clause modifier to the main verb kazan (15th token).\n- Merkür (8th token) is the subject of the verb al (11th token) and also the subject of the main verb kazan (15th token).\n- Mars (9th token) in the genitive case is a possessive modifier for the noun zihinsellik (10th token).\n- Zihinsellik (10th token) is the direct object of the verb al (11th token).\n- The verb al (11th token) is imperative, affirmative, and in converb form, serving as an adverbial clause modifier to the main verb kazan (15th token).\n- Entellektüel (12th token) is an adjective modifying the noun boyut (14th token).\n- Bir (13th token) is a determiner for the noun boyut (14th token).\n- Boyut (14th token) is the direct object of the main verb kazan (15th token).\n- The main verb kazan (15th token) is in the future tense, singular and third person, and is the root of the sentence.\n- A punctuation mark (7th and 16th tokens) is present, which typically denotes the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting all these elements together while applying Turkish grammar rules, we get:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Mars, Merkür'e enerjiyi iletişim gücüyle aktarırken, Merkür Mars'ın zihinsellik al, entellektüel bir boyut kazanacak.\"}\n```\n\nPlease note that the construction of some parts of the sentence, especially the verbs in converb form (which is not a typical form in Turkish and seems to be a translation error), might not make perfect sense. The word \"güç\" is typically a noun, but based on the provided features, it is treated as a verb. Additionally, \"aktarırken\" is used to imply \"while transferring\" to align with the converb form of \"aktar\" and \"al\" as modifiers. The use of \"kazanacak\" reflects the future tense of the verb \"kazan.\""

The lemma \"çevrili\" is given as a part of speech of punctuation, which does not align with the typical use of the word \"çevrili\" as a Turkish word, which could be part of a verb meaning \"to be surrounded\". Moreover, a verb would make more sense syntactically as the root of a sentence. Assuming that the 4th token is a verb and that there was a typographical error in describing it as punctuation, the surface form of the sentence would be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"\\\"Füzeler ABD'ye çevrili\\\"\"}\n```\n\nHowever, if the 4th token is indeed a verb, then it would be appropriate to use the correct lemma \"çevril\" (to be turned or to be directed) and add the necessary suffix to match the plural subject \"füzeler\". The proper noun \"ABD\" should take the dative case suffix \"-ye\" or \"-ya\" depending on vowel harmony. Since \"ABD\" ends in a back vowel, the correct suffix is \"-ye\". The quotation marks should be placed at the beginning and end of the sentence, as indicated by the 1st and 5th tokens. The correct sentence form should then be:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"\\\"Füzeler ABD'ye çevrili\\\"\"}\n```\n\nThis response assumes the sentence is a quote or statement being highlighted by the use of quotation marks at the beginning and end."

        "output": "Based on the given analysis of the Turkish sentence, we can reconstruct the original form as follows:\n\n- The `1st` token \"akşam\" is a noun in the nominative case, singular number, third person, and acts as an oblique argument or adjunct.\n- The `2nd` token \"geri\" is an adverb that modifies the `3rd` token.\n- The `3rd` token \"ver\" is an affirmative verb acting as a nominal modifier.\n- The `4th` token \"ben\" is a first person singular pronoun in the dative case, acting as an oblique argument or adjunct.\n- The `5th` token \"göz\" is a noun in the accusative case, plural number, with a third person singular possessor, acting as a direct object.\n- The `6th` token is a punctuation mark, likely quotation marks.\n- The `7th` token \"o\" is a determiner for the `8th` token.\n- The `8th` token \"gör\" is a third person singular past participle with a second person singular possessor.\n- The `9th` token \"yüzlerce\" is a numeral modifying the `10th` token.\n- The `10th` token \"kafatası\" is a noun in the nominative case, singular number, with a third person singular possessor.\n- The `11th` token \"iç\" is an adjective in the locative case, singular number, with a third person singular possessor.\n- The `12th` token \"yedi\" is a noun in the nominative case, singular number, with a third person singular possessor.\n- The `13th` token \"oğul\" is a verb in the nominative case, plural number, with a first person singular possessor and is the root token.\n- The `14th` token is an auxiliary verb \"y\" indicating the perfect aspect, indicative mood, singular number, third person, past tense, and acts as a copula to the `13th` token.\n- The `15th` token is a punctuation mark, likely a period.\n\nThe sentence is likely to be something like this (assuming the sixth token represents quotation marks which is common in Turkish when dealing with direct speech or specific titles):\n\n\"Akşam geri verilmiş bana gözleri \"O görülmüş yüzlerce kafatasının içinde yedi oğulluydu.\"\n\nHowever, since the `8th` token \"gör\" is a participle form, it should be part of a compound noun with \"oğul\" as in \"oğlan görülmüş\" (a boy who has been seen). Also, the construct \"yedi oğulluydu\" implies that the verb \"oğul\" and the auxiliary \"y\" form a past tense meaning \"it was of seven sons\" or \"it had seven sons.\" There may be variations in the surface form depending on the nuances of Turkish syntax and morphology, especially since the example is complex and involves participles and compound nouns.\n\nPlease note that the exact surface form might vary slightly based on context and specific syntactic rules of Turkish, which are not fully available in the provided analysis.\n\nHere is the sentence in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Akşam geri verilmiş bana gözleri \\\"O görülmüş yüzlerce kafatasının içinde yedi oğulluydu.\\\"\"}\n```"
