The adposition \"sonra\" depends on it, suggesting a phrase \"kırktan sonra\" meaning \"after forty\".\n* The noun \"tempo\" is the nominal subject of the sentence, and it depends on the verb \"hız\" (token 6).\n* The verb \"inan\" is a participle in the passive voice, negated, and depends on the noun \"biçim\" (token 5). This suggests a phrase \"inanılmayan bir biçim\" meaning \"an unbelievable form\".\n* The noun \"biçim\" is in the locative case, indicating a location or position, and depends on the verb \"hız\" (token 6).\n* The verb \"hız\" is the root token, in the present tense, and has a habitual aspect. It agrees with the subject \"tempo\" in number and person.\n* Finally, the punctuation token \".\" depends on the verb \"hız\" and marks the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the sentence \"Kırktan sonra tempo inanılmayan bir biçim hızlanır.\""

The first token \"delikli\" is a noun and an adjectival modifier of the second token \"kepçe\", so it's likely to be an adjective modifying the noun \"kepçe\". The surface form could be \"delikli kepçe\".\n2. The second token \"kepçe\" is a noun and the head of the phrase, so it remains as \"kepçe\".\n3. The third token \"ile\" is a coordinating conjunction and marks the case of the preceding noun \"kepçe\", so it's likely to be an instrumental case marker. The surface form could be \"delikli kepçe ile\".\n4. The fourth token \"çık\" is a verb in the imperative mood, plural number, and second person. It's likely to be in the causative voice, which is often marked with the suffix \"-dır\" in Turkish. The surface form could be \"çıkartın\".\n5. The fifth token is a punctuation mark, which is a period at the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, I get:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Delikli kepçe ile çıkartın.\"}\n\nPlease note that Turkish morphology can be complex, and there might be multiple possible surface forms. This is just one possible reconstruction based on the provided features."

So, \"Meral ile\" means \"with Meral\".\n* The fourth token \"vedalaş\" is a verbal noun in the accusative case, indicating it's the direct object of the verb \"iste\" (meaning \"to want\" or \"to wish\"). The verb \"iste\" is in the perfect aspect, indicating a completed action in the past. So, \"vedalaşmıştım\" means \"I had bid farewell\" or \"I had said goodbye\".\n* The sixth token \"söyle\" is the root token, and its dependencies indicate it's the main verb of the sentence. In the perfect aspect, it means \"I said\" or \"I told\".\n* Putting it all together, the sentence \"Namazdan önce Meral ile vedalaşmıştım\" means \"I said I had bid farewell to Meral before the prayer\".\n\nPlease note that Turkish sentence structure can be complex, and there might be multiple possible surface forms for a given set of linguistic features.

In Turkish, the possessive pronoun \"bu\" is usually translated to \"this\" or \"its\".\n* The second token \"sonuç\" is a noun in the locative case, which suggests it's indicating a location or direction. In this context, it's likely to be translated to \"in this result\" or \"to this result\".\n* The third token \"yüzlerce\" is a numeral indicating a large quantity, which is likely to be translated to \"hundreds\".\n* The fourth token \"İngilizce\" is a proper noun, which is likely to be an adjective modifying the noun \"site\". In Turkish, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, so I placed it after \"site\".\n* The fifth token \"site\" is a noun in the nominative case, which suggests it's the subject of the sentence.\n* The sixth token \"gel\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, which suggests it's describing a completed action. The verb \"gel\" is usually translated to \"come\" or \"has come\".\n* The seventh token is a punctuation mark, which I ignored in the reconstruction.\n\nPutting all these tokens together, I arrived at the sentence \"Bu sonuc yüzlerce İngilizce site gelmiş.\", which roughly translates to \"This result has hundreds of English sites.\""

The first token \"Ahmet\" is a proper noun in the genitive case, which suggests it's a possessive form. In Turkish, the genitive suffix for singular nouns is \"-in\" or \"-ın\". So, the surface form of the first token is \"Ahmet'in\".\n2. The second token \"geri\" is an adjective that depends on the fourth token with a clausal complement relation. This suggests that \"geri\" is a predicate adjective. Its surface form remains \"geri\".\n3. The third token \"dön\" is a verb in the accusative case, which is unusual. However, considering its dependency relation with the second token as a compound, I'll assume it's a part of a compound verb. In Turkish, the verb \"dön\" means \"to return\" or \"to turn back\". When combined with \"geri\", it forms the compound verb \"geri dön\", which means \"to turn back\" or \"to return back\".\n4. The fourth token \"karar\" is a verb with a perfect aspect, first-hand evidentiality, plural number, and first-person person. Its surface form is likely \"karar kıldım\" (I decided).\n5. The fifth token is a punctuation mark, which is a period.\n\nNow, let's combine the tokens to form the surface sentence:\n\nAhmet'in geri dön kararı kıldım.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Ahmet'in geri dön kararı kıldım.\"}"

The possessor's number and person are both third person plural, suggesting that the regions belong to them.\n* The second token \"ayrıl\" is a verb in the nominative case, negated, and in the present tense. However, its form is participle, which suggests it's being used as an adjective to describe the regions.\n* The third token \"bile\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"ayrıl\", indicating \"even\" or \"also\".\n* The fourth token \"kır\" is a noun in the ablative case, suggesting movement from a mountain or a rugged area.\n* The fifth token \"kent\" is a noun in the dative case, indicating movement to a city.\n* The sixth token \"göç\" is a noun in the nominative case, which is the root token. It means \"migration\" or \"moving\".\n* The seventh token \"et\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, indicating completed action. It's in the past tense, and its evidentiality is first-hand, suggesting that the speaker has direct knowledge of the event. The verb \"et\" is often used in light verb constructions, which is consistent with its dependency relation.\n* The eighth token is an ellipsis, indicating that the sentence is incomplete or trailing off.\n\nPutting it all together, I arrived at the sentence \"Bölgelerinden bile kır kentine göç etmişler...\".

It depends on the second token \"su\" with a possessive nominal modifier relation, so it's likely to be in the genitive form \"sel suyun\".\n* The second token \"su\" is a noun in locative case, plural number, and third person. It depends on the fourth token \"yok\" with an oblique argument or adjunct relation, so it's likely to be in the locative form \"suyu\".\n* The third token \"ne\" is a pronoun in nominative case, plural number, and third person. It depends on the fourth token \"yok\" with a nominal subject relation, so it's likely to be in the nominative form \"ne\".\n* The fourth and fifth tokens \"yok\" and \"y\" form a single word. The lemma \"yok\" is a noun with negative polarity, and the lemma \"y\" is an auxiliary verb with perfect aspect, first-hand evidentiality, and positive polarity. This combination suggests the verb \"yokmuş\" (had not been).\n* The sixth token \"ki\" is a particle that depends on the fourth token \"yok\" with an emphasizing word relation, so it's likely to be used to introduce a subordinate clause.\n* The seventh token \"...\" is a punctuation mark that depends on the fourth token \"yok\" with a punctuation relation, so it's likely to be an ellipsis at the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, I arrived at the surface form \"Sel suyun ne yokmuş ki...\"."

        "output": "Based on the provided linguistic features, I'll try to reconstruct the surface form of the sentence.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n1. The first token \"elma\" (noun, nominative/direct, singular, 3rd person) depends on the 2nd token with a possessive nominal modifier relation, so it's likely to be in the genitive case. The genitive form of \"elma\" is \"elmanın\".\n2. The second token \"dilim\" (noun, accusative, plural, 3rd person) is the possessed noun, and it depends on the 4th token with a direct object relation.\n3. The third token \"tabak\" (noun, dative, plural, 3rd person) depends on the 4th token with an oblique argument or adjunct relation, so it's likely to be in the dative case. The dative form of \"tabak\" is \"tabaklara\".\n4. The fourth token \"bölüş\" (verb, imperative, plural, 2nd person) is the root token, and it's in the imperative mood, which means it's a command. The verb \"bölüş\" in the imperative mood, plural, 2nd person is \"bölüşün\".\n5. The fifth token is a punctuation mark, which is a period.\n\nTaking all these into account, I think the surface form of the sentence is:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Elmanın dilimlerini tabaklara bölüşün.\"}\n\nPlease let me know if this is correct or not!"

In Turkish, the dative case is marked with the suffix \"-a\" or \"-e\", so \"siz\" becomes \"siz'e\" or \"siz'a\". I'll choose the latter.\n4. The fourth token is \"ne\", a pronoun in the accusative case, which is the direct object.\n5. The fifth token is the verb \"hatırla\", which is in the progressive aspect, present tense, causative voice, and third person singular. The verb conjugation for \"hatırla\" in this form would be \"hatırlatıyorsunuz\", which is a causative verb form.\n6. The sixth token is a punctuation mark \"?\", which is a question mark.\n\nPutting it all together, I get the sentence \"- İstanbul'a siz ne hatırlatıyorsunuz?\"."

The 2nd and 3rd tokens form a single word. The 2nd token \"neden\" is an adverb, and the 3rd token \"y\" is an auxiliary verb with specific features (non-first hand evidentiality, singular number, third person, positive/affirmative, past tense). This suggests that the 2nd and 3rd tokens form a single word \"nediy\" (why was).\n3. The 4th token \"o\" is a pronoun with specific features (nominative/direct case, singular number, third person, personal pronominal type). This suggests that the 4th token is the pronoun \"o\" (he/she/it).\n4. The 5th token is a punctuation mark \"?\" which depends on the 2nd token with a punctuation relation.

The first token \"Tamam\" is an interjection, which is likely to be used as a discourse element.\n2. The second token is a comma, which separates the interjection from the rest of the sentence.\n3. The third token \"dey\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, indicative mood, and converb form. It likely functions as an adverbial clause modifier.\n4. The fourth token \"görüşme\" is a verb in the dative case, singular number, and third person. It's in the verbal noun form and functions as a clausal complement.\n5. The fifth token \"git\" is the main verb, in the habitual aspect, singular number, third person, and present tense.\n6. The sixth token is a period, which marks the end of the sentence.\n\nTaking these features into account, I propose the following surface form:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Tamam, deyince görüşmeye gider.\"}\n\nPlease note that Turkish is a highly inflected language, and the surface form may vary depending on the context and dialect.

It depends on the 6th token, which is the verb \"ver\". This suggests that the apostrophe is attached to the proper noun \"Allah\", making it \"Allah'ıma\" (Allah's to me).\n* The 2nd token \"Allah\" is a proper noun in the nominative case, and it depends on the 6th token with a vocative relation, which is consistent with the interpretation above.\n* The 3rd token \"!\" is an exclamation mark, which depends on the 6th token. This suggests that it's used to emphasize the imperative verb \"ver\".\n* The 4th token \"ben\" is a pronoun in the dative case, which depends on the 6th token with an oblique argument or adjunct relation. This is consistent with the interpretation that \"ben\" is the indirect object of the verb \"ver\".\n* The 5th token \"güç\" is a noun in the accusative case, which depends on the 6th token with a direct object relation. This suggests that \"güç\" is the direct object of the verb \"ver\".\n* The 6th token \"ver\" is the root token, a verb in the imperative mood, which is consistent with the interpretation above.\n* The 7th token \".\" is a punctuation token that depends on the 6th token, which suggests that it's a period at the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, I get the sentence \"Allah'ıma ben güç ver!.\"."

The first token \"2\" is a cardinal numeral, which depends on the 3rd token \"kaşık\" as a numeric modifier. This suggests that the surface form of the numeral is likely \"iki\" (Turkish for \"two\").\n2. The second token \"çorba\" is a noun, which depends on the 3rd token \"kaşık\" as a possessive nominal modifier. This implies that the surface form of \"çorba\" is likely \"çorbası\" (possessive form of \"çorba\", meaning \"of the soup\").\n3. The third token \"kaşık\" is a noun, which depends on the 4th token \"tereyağı\" as an adjectival modifier. This suggests that the surface form of \"kaşık\" is likely \"kaşık\" itself, without any modification.\n4. The fourth token \"tereyağı\" is a noun, which is the root token. Its surface form is likely \"tereyağı\" itself.\n\nTaking these into account, I propose the following surface form for the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"İki çorbası kaşık tereyağı.\"}\n\nPlease let me know if this is correct or if I need to make any adjustments!"

The first token \"iki\" is a numeral, which depends on the second token \"veli\" with a numeric modifier relation. This suggests that \"iki\" is modifying \"veli\", so the surface form is \"iki veli\".\n2. The second token \"veli\" is a noun, which depends on the fourth token with a nominal subject relation. This implies that \"veli\" is the subject of the sentence.\n3. The third token \"dokun\" is a verb in the desiderative mood, which depends on the fourth token with an adverbial clause modifier relation. This suggests that \"dokun\" is a subordinate clause modifying the main verb.\n4. The fourth and fifth tokens form a single word. The fourth token \"ağla\" is a verb in the prospective aspect, and the fifth token \"y\" is an auxiliary verb in the perfect aspect. This combination suggests a verb form in the past perfect tense. The surface form of this verb is likely \"ağlayacakmış\".\n5. The sixth token is a punctuation mark, which depends on the fourth token with a punctuation relation. This implies that the sentence ends with a period.\n\nTaking all these features into account, I propose the following surface form for the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"İki veli dokunmak ağlayacakmış.\"}\n\nPlease note that Turkish has complex morphology and syntax, and there might be alternative surface forms that are also grammatically correct.

However, since the sentence is in the past tense (due to the verb \"de\" in token 7), I used the past tense form \"sevgiliydim\" (I loved you).\n* The verb \"de\" is in the past tense, third person singular, and affirmative, which corresponds to the form \"de\" (it was).\n* Finally, the punctuation mark \".\" is attached to the end of the sentence.\n\nPlease note that Turkish is a highly inflected language, and the surface form of a sentence can be ambiguous or open to interpretation.

It depends on the proper noun \"Turgut\", which suggests a possessive relationship (Hermes'ten = from Hermes).\n* The proper noun \"Turgut\" is in the nominative case and depends on the main verb, suggesting it's the direct object.\n* The proper noun \"Bey\" is in the instrumental case and depends on \"Turgut\", which suggests it's a title or honorific (Turgut Bey).\n* The main verb \"görüş\" is in the prospective aspect, first person singular, and future tense, which suggests the sentence is about a future meeting or encounter.\n* The final punctuation token \".\" depends on the main verb, indicating the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, I arrived at the surface form \"- Şefik, yarın Hermes'ten Turgut Bey'i görüşeceğim.\""

The fact that it's the root token implies it's the central element of the sentence.\n\nTaking these features into account, I propose the following surface form:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Adaçayı (elma) yağ\"}\n\nThis sentence can be translated to English as \"Adaçayı's oil (of apple)\"."

The first token \"su\" (noun, nominative/direct, singular, third person) depends on the second token \"yer\" (noun, dative, singular, third person) with a possessive nominal modifier relation. This suggests that \"su\" is a possessive modifier of \"yer\", so the surface form should be \"su yer\" (meaning \"its place\" or \"the place of it\").\n2. The second token \"yer\" (noun, dative, singular, third person) depends on the fourth token \"dol\" (verb, imperative, singular, second person) with an oblique argument or adjunct relation. This suggests that \"yer\" is an indirect object of the verb \"dol\".\n3. The third token \"iyilik\" (noun, instrumental, singular, third person) also depends on the fourth token \"dol\" with an oblique argument or adjunct relation. This suggests that \"iyilik\" is an instrumental object of the verb \"dol\".\n4. The fourth token \"dol\" (verb, imperative, singular, second person) is the root token, and its surface form should be in the imperative mood, second person singular. The verb \"dol\" means \"fill\" in Turkish, so the surface form should be \"doldur\" (meaning \"fill it\").\n5.

The first token is a quotation mark, which is usually written as „ in Turkish.\n2. The second token \"En\" is an adverb, which depends on the third token \"küçük\" with an adverbial modifier relation. This suggests that \"En\" modifies \"küçük\", so we get \"En küçük\".\n3. The third token \"küçük\" is an adjective, which depends on the fourth token \"oğul\" with an adjectival modifier relation. This suggests that \"küçük\" modifies \"oğul\", so we get \"küçük oğul\".\n4. The fourth token \"oğul\" is a noun, which depends on the fifth token \"Mahmut\" with a nominal modifier relation. This suggests that \"oğul\" is possessed by \"Mahmut\", so we get \"oğlum Mahmut\".\n5. The fifth token \"Mahmut\" is a proper noun, which depends on the ninth token with a nominal subject relation. This suggests that \"Mahmut\" is the subject of the sentence.\n6. The sixth token \"can\" is a proper noun, which depends on the fifth token \"Mahmut\" with a name relation. This suggests that \"can\" is part of the name \"Mahmut can\".\n7. The seventh token is a comma, which depends on the ninth token with a punctuation relation. This suggests that the comma separates the name \"Mahmut can\" from the rest of the sentence.\n8. The eighth token \"çok\" is an adverb, which depends on the ninth token with an adjectival modifier relation. This suggests that \"çok\" modifies the adjective \"zeki\".\n9. The ninth and tenth tokens make up a single word. The ninth token \"zeki\" is an adjective, and the tenth token \"y\" is an auxiliary verb with a copula relation to \"zeki\". This suggests that the verb \"y\" is used to form the past tense of the adjective \"zeki\", resulting in \"zekiydi\".\n10. The eleventh token is a period, which depends on the ninth token with a punctuation relation. This suggests that the period marks the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the sentence: „En küçük oğlum Mahmut can, çok zekiydi."

This suggests that \"böyle\" is modifying the noun \"birlik\".\n4. \"hep\" (adverb) depends on the 5th token with an adverbial modifier relation. This implies that \"hep\" is also modifying the noun \"birlik\".\n5. \"birlik\" (noun, locative, singular, 3rd person) is the root token.\n\nConsidering the dependencies and morphological features, I'll try to reconstruct the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Nedir güzel böyle hep birliğinde?\"}\n\nPlease note that Turkish sentence structure can be complex, and there might be multiple possible surface forms.

Here's my answer:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Trabzonspor Galatasaray'a karşı tarih yazıldı!\"}\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this answer:\n\n* The first token \"Trabzonspor\" is a proper noun and depends on the 4th token \"tarih\" with a possessive nominal modifier relation, so it's likely to be in the genitive case. In Turkish, the genitive case is marked with the suffix \"-ın\" or \"-in\", so I added \"-ın\" to \"Trabzonspor\".\n* The second token \"Galatasaray\" is also a proper noun and depends on the 3rd token \"karşı\" with a possessive nominal modifier relation, so it's likely to be in the genitive case as well. I added the suffix \"-a\" to \"Galatasaray\" to indicate the genitive case.\n* The third token \"karşı\" is a noun in the locative case, which is marked with the suffix \"-da\" or \"-de\" in Turkish. However, since it depends on the 4th token \"tarih\" with an oblique argument or adjunct relation, I didn't add any suffix to \"karşı\".\n* The fourth token \"tarih\" is a noun and the root token, so it remains unchanged.\n* The fifth token \"yaz\" is a verb in the past tense, and its suffix is \"-dı\" or \"-di\" in Turkish. Since it depends on the 4th token \"tarih\" with a compound relation, I added the suffix \"-dı\" to \"yaz\" to form the verb \"yazıldı\".\n* The sixth token \"!\" is a punctuation mark and depends on the 4th token \"tarih\" with a punctuation relation, so I added it to the end of the sentence.\n* The seventh token \"..\" is another punctuation mark and depends on the 4th token \"tarih\" with a punctuation relation, but I didn't include it in the final sentence since it's not necessary for the sentence's grammaticality.\n\nNote that Turkish is a highly inflected language, and the surface form of a sentence can vary depending on the context and dialect. This is just one possible reconstruction of the sentence based on the provided linguistic features."

Here's my answer:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Kalanı da bardaklar arasında bölüşün.\"}\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this answer:\n\n* The first token \"kalan\" is a noun in nominative case, singular number, and third person. It depends on the second token \"don\" with a clausal modifier of noun relation. This suggests that \"kalan\" is a possessive noun, so I added the possessive suffix \"-ı\" to get \"kalanı\".\n* The second token \"don\" is a verb in accusative case, singular number, and third person. It depends on the sixth token \"bölüş\" with a direct object relation. However, since \"don\" is in accusative case, it's likely that it's an object of the verb \"bölüş\". I didn't include \"don\" in the final sentence because its meaning is not clear in this context.\n* The third token \"da\" is a particle that depends on the second token \"don\" with an emphasizing word relation. I included it in the sentence as \"da\".\n* The fourth token \"bardak\" is a noun in nominative case, plural number, and third person. It depends on the fifth token \"ara\" with a possessive nominal modifier relation. This suggests that \"bardak\" is a possessed noun, so I added the possessive suffix \"-lar\" to get \"bardaklar\".\n* The fifth token \"ara\" is a noun in locative case, singular number, and third person. It depends on the sixth token \"bölüş\" with an oblique argument or adjunct relation. I included it in the sentence as \"arasında\".\n* The sixth token \"bölüş\" is a verb in imperative mood, plural number, and second person. It's the root token, so I included it in the sentence as \"bölüşün\".\n* The seventh token is a punctuation mark that depends on the sixth token \"bölüş\" with a punctuation relation. I included it in the sentence as \".\".\n\nPutting it all together, I arrived at the sentence \"Kalanı da bardaklar arasında bölüşün.\""

The 1st token \"biz\" (pronoun, genitive, plural, 1st person) depends on the 2nd token \"Şefik\" (proper noun, nominative, singular, 3rd person) with a possessive nominal modifier relation. This suggests that \"biz\" is a possessive adjective modifying \"Şefik\", which would be \"Bizim Şefik\" in Turkish.\n2. The 2nd token \"Şefik\" is the subject of the sentence.\n3. The 3rd token \"dert\" (noun, nominative, singular, 3rd person) depends on the 4th token \"dağıtım\" (noun, nominative, singular, 3rd person) with a direct object relation. This suggests that \"dert\" is the direct object of \"dağıtım\", which would be \"dert dağıtım\" in Turkish.\n4. The 4th token \"dağıtım\" depends on the 5th token \"merkez\" (noun, nominative, singular, 3rd person) with a possessive nominal modifier relation. This suggests that \"dağıtım\" is a possessive noun modifying \"merkez\", which would be \"dağıtım merkezi\" in Turkish.\n5. The 5th token \"merkez\" is the root token and the main noun of the sentence.\n6. The 6th token \"sanki\" (adverb) depends on the 5th token \"merkez\" with an adverbial modifier relation. This suggests that \"sanki\" is an adverb modifying the verb or the sentence as a whole.\n7. The 7th token is a punctuation mark (period) that depends on the 5th token \"merkez\" with a punctuation relation.\n\nTaking all these relations into account, I propose the following surface form for the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Bizim Şefik sanki dert dağıtım merkezi.\"}\n\nPlease note that this is my best attempt based on the provided linguistic features, but the actual surface form might vary depending on the context and nuances of the Turkish language."
