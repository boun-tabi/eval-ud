This is supported by the fact that it depends on the 2nd token \"iritsi\" with the relation of oblique nominal.\n* The 2nd token \"iritsi\" is the root token and has the form of a participle, which is a common way to form adverbial phrases in Basque.\n* The 3rd token \"izan\" is an auxiliary verb that agrees with the absolutive argument (which is the 2nd token \"iritsi\") in person and number. It's likely to be a finite verb in the indicative mood.\n* The 4th token \"bertara\" is an adverb that modifies the verb \"iritsi\" and indicates the direction or location of the action.\n* The 5th token \".\" is a punctuation mark that depends on the 2nd token \"iritsi\" with the relation of punctuation.\n\nPutting it all together, the surface form of the sentence is \"Gau iritsi niz bertara\", which can be translated to \"I entered into the gau\"."
