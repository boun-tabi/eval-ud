        "output": "To arrive at the correct surface form of the sentence from the provided morphological and syntactic details, we need to consider the forms of the words based on their grammatical features, such as lenition, possession, and definiteness.\n\n1. **Particle \"do\"** modifies the verb and is prefixed.\n2. **Verb \"iarr\"** is in past tense.\n3. **Pronoun \"sé\"** is the subject, meaning \"he\".\n4. **Adposition \"mar\"** marks the case of the noun that follows.\n5. **Noun \"bean\"** undergoes lenition, indicated by \"Form is lenition\", which generally manifests as an initial mutation (e.g., from 'b' to 'bh').\n6. **Pronoun \"í\"** is a nominal modifier of \"bean\", indicating \"her\".\n7. **Adposition \"ar\"** marks the case of the noun that follows.\n8. **Determiner \"a\"** indicates possession, which means it's possessive \"her\" in English but used differently in Irish. It modifies \"athair\" and may cause initial mutation.\n9. **Noun \"athair\"** has the form \"h-prefix\" indicating an initial mutation due to the possessive pronoun, likely becoming \"hathair\".\n10. **Punctuation \".\"**\n\nPutting these elements together and considering Irish syntax and morphology, the sentence would look like this:\n\n\"D'iarraigh sé mar bhean í ar a hathair.\"\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- \"D'iarraigh\" because \"do\" + \"iarr\" in past tense often causes an initial mutation and contraction in Irish.\n- \"sé\" remains unchanged as it's a simple pronoun.\n- \"mar bhean\" shows the lenition of \"bean\" to \"bhean\".\n- \"í\" is directly attached to \"bhean\".\n- \"ar a hathair\" where \"a\" causes the h-prefix on \"athair\" turning it into \"hathair\".\n\nThus, the JSON format output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"D'iarraigh sé mar bhean í ar a hathair.\"\n}\n```"

In Irish, the specifics of lenition, eclipsis, and definite articles significantly affect the surface forms of words. Here's how we can analyze and build the sentence:\n\n1. **bí** - Verb, present tense, indicative mood. It's the root of the sentence.\n2. **aontas** - Noun, singular, masculine, subject of \"bí\".\n3. **eacnamaíoch** - Adjective modifying \"aontas\".\n4. **agus** - Coordinating conjunction, linking \"aontas eacnamaíoch\" with \"airgeadaíocht\".\n5. **airgeadaíocht** - Noun, singular, feminine, in genitive case; it is part of the conjunct linked by \"agus\".\n6. **ar** - Adposition marking the case of \"ceann\".\n7. **ceann** - Noun, masculine, singular; lenited form due to the adposition \"ar\".\n8. **de** - Adposition marking the case of \"príomhchuspóir\".\n9. **príomhchuspóir** - Noun, masculine, plural; lenited form due to the adposition \"de\".\n10. **an** - Determiner, definite article for \"AE\".\n11. **AE** - Proper noun, abbreviated form indicating \"European Union\" (in English).\n12. **.** - Punctuation.\n\nConsidering the grammatical rules:\n- Adpositions in Irish often cause lenition.\n- The definite article \"an\" precedes a proper noun or a noun that is definite and singular.\n- The conjunction \"agus\" connects two phrases or words.\n\nHence, the sentence constructed considering the morphological changes due to grammatical rules and dependencies will be:\n\n**\"Bíonn aontas eacnamaíoch agus airgeadaíocht ar cheann de phríomhchuspóirí an AE.\"**\n\nIn this constructed sentence:\n- \"Bíonn\" is the present habitual form of \"bí\".\n- \"ar cheann\" due to lenition caused by \"ar\".\n- \"de phríomhchuspóirí\" reflects lenition due to \"de\".\n\nThus, the JSON format of the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Bíonn aontas eacnamaíoch agus airgeadaíocht ar cheann de phríomhchuspóirí an AE.\"\n}\n```"

        "output": "To reconstruct the sentence from the given tokens and their grammatical annotations, we must consider the particulars of Irish syntax and morphology, such as lenition, grammatical cases, and possessive structures. Below is the analysis and reconstruction:\n\n1. **bí** - Verb, past tense, lenited form. As the root token, it would typically appear as \"Bhí\".\n2. **a** - Determiner, masculine singular possessive, third person. This would typically modify the following noun to indicate possession, i.e., \"a\".\n3. **cuid** - Noun, nominative/accusative, definite, feminine singular, lenited. The lenition of \"cuid\" due to the preceding possessive determiner would be \"chuid\".\n4. **féasóg** - Noun, genitive singular, feminine. Since it modifies \"cuid\", it remains in its base form \"féasóg\".\n5. **thar** - Adposition. In Irish, adpositions can precede the noun they relate to; thus, it remains \"thar\".\n6. **am** - Noun, nominative/accusative, definite, masculine singular. The phrase it belongs to is an adpositional phrase marked by \"thar\", leading to \"thar am\".\n7. **a** - Determiner, feminine singular possessive, third person. This would typically modify the following noun to indicate possession, i.e., \"a\".\n8. **bearradh** - Noun, genitive case, definite, infinitive form of a verb. The possession and case would typically have it appear as \"bearrtha\".\n9. **.** - Punctuation marks the end of the sentence.\n\nReconstructing these into a coherent sentence, considering the syntactic structure of Irish:\n\n**\"Bhí a chuid féasóg thar am a bearrtha.\"**\n\nThis translates to \"His portion of the beard was overdue to be trimmed.\" The structure reflects possessive determiners modifying nouns, a temporal adpositional phrase, and genitive constructions in the context of the whole sentence. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\"original_form\": \"Bhí a chuid féasóg thar am a bearrtha.\"}\n```"

The phrase is enclosed in single quotation marks, which are associated with the verb `glac`.\n- The main sentence starts with `abair` (meaning \"say\") as the root. It is a common structure in Irish to start a statement with `abair` when indicating that someone is speaking or about to speak.\n- `Páraic` is the subject of `abair`, and it is followed by a comma and the emphatic pronoun `mise` (meaning \"I myself\"), which provides emphasis on the speaker.\n- The phrase `mo chuid clabaireacht` follows, connected by `agus` (meaning \"and\"). Here, `mo` (possessive \"my\") modifies `cuid` (which generally translates to \"part\" or \"portion\" but here likely refers to something akin to \"matter\" or \"affair\"), and `clabaireacht` (meaning \"chatter\" or \"natter\") is the genitive modifier of `cuid`, describing the type of matter being referred to.\n- The sentence ends with a period.\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the sentence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"' ó glac pardún ag ' abair Páraic , mise agus mo chuid clabaireacht .\"\n}\n```"
