        "output": "To arrive at the correct surface form of the sentence from the provided morphological and syntactic details, we need to consider the forms of the words based on their grammatical features, such as lenition, possession, and definiteness.\n\n1. **Particle \"do\"** modifies the verb and is prefixed.\n2. **Verb \"iarr\"** is in past tense.\n3. **Pronoun \"sé\"** is the subject, meaning \"he\".\n4. **Adposition \"mar\"** marks the case of the noun that follows.\n5. **Noun \"bean\"** undergoes lenition, indicated by \"Form is lenition\", which generally manifests as an initial mutation (e.g., from 'b' to 'bh').\n6. **Pronoun \"í\"** is a nominal modifier of \"bean\", indicating \"her\".\n7. **Adposition \"ar\"** marks the case of the noun that follows.\n8. **Determiner \"a\"** indicates possession, which means it's possessive \"her\" in English but used differently in Irish. It modifies \"athair\" and may cause initial mutation.\n9. **Noun \"athair\"** has the form \"h-prefix\" indicating an initial mutation due to the possessive pronoun, likely becoming \"hathair\".\n10. **Punctuation \".\"**\n\nPutting these elements together and considering Irish syntax and morphology, the sentence would look like this:\n\n\"D'iarraigh sé mar bhean í ar a hathair.\"\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- \"D'iarraigh\" because \"do\" + \"iarr\" in past tense often causes an initial mutation and contraction in Irish.\n- \"sé\" remains unchanged as it's a simple pronoun.\n- \"mar bhean\" shows the lenition of \"bean\" to \"bhean\".\n- \"í\" is directly attached to \"bhean\".\n- \"ar a hathair\" where \"a\" causes the h-prefix on \"athair\" turning it into \"hathair\".\n\nThus, the JSON format output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"D'iarraigh sé mar bhean í ar a hathair.\"\n}\n```"

In Irish, the specifics of lenition, eclipsis, and definite articles significantly affect the surface forms of words. Here's how we can analyze and build the sentence:\n\n1. **bí** - Verb, present tense, indicative mood. It's the root of the sentence.\n2. **aontas** - Noun, singular, masculine, subject of \"bí\".\n3. **eacnamaíoch** - Adjective modifying \"aontas\".\n4. **agus** - Coordinating conjunction, linking \"aontas eacnamaíoch\" with \"airgeadaíocht\".\n5. **airgeadaíocht** - Noun, singular, feminine, in genitive case; it is part of the conjunct linked by \"agus\".\n6. **ar** - Adposition marking the case of \"ceann\".\n7. **ceann** - Noun, masculine, singular; lenited form due to the adposition \"ar\".\n8. **de** - Adposition marking the case of \"príomhchuspóir\".\n9. **príomhchuspóir** - Noun, masculine, plural; lenited form due to the adposition \"de\".\n10. **an** - Determiner, definite article for \"AE\".\n11. **AE** - Proper noun, abbreviated form indicating \"European Union\" (in English).\n12. **.** - Punctuation.\n\nConsidering the grammatical rules:\n- Adpositions in Irish often cause lenition.\n- The definite article \"an\" precedes a proper noun or a noun that is definite and singular.\n- The conjunction \"agus\" connects two phrases or words.\n\nHence, the sentence constructed considering the morphological changes due to grammatical rules and dependencies will be:\n\n**\"Bíonn aontas eacnamaíoch agus airgeadaíocht ar cheann de phríomhchuspóirí an AE.\"**\n\nIn this constructed sentence:\n- \"Bíonn\" is the present habitual form of \"bí\".\n- \"ar cheann\" due to lenition caused by \"ar\".\n- \"de phríomhchuspóirí\" reflects lenition due to \"de\".\n\nThus, the JSON format of the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Bíonn aontas eacnamaíoch agus airgeadaíocht ar cheann de phríomhchuspóirí an AE.\"\n}\n```"
