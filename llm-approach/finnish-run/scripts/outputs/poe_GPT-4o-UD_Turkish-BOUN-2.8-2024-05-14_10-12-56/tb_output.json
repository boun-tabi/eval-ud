It depends on the 4th token (mesai) as part of a compound structure.\n6. **Konusu** - Noun, genitive case, singular, third person. The genitive case here indicates possession by the nominalized verb \"yapması\".\n7. **Da** - Coordinating conjunction, emphasizing the noun at the 6th position.\n8. **Ele** - Noun, dative case, singular, third person. Indicates the direction or target of the action.\n9. **Alınacak** - Verb, future tense, positive, participle form. Functions as a descriptive part of the structure.\n10. **İfade** - Noun, nominative case, singular, third person. Acts as the root of the sentence, indicating the main action or expression.\n11. **Ediliyor** - Verb, present tense, progressive aspect, passive voice. Completes the light verb construction with \"ifade\".\n12. **.** - Punctuation, marks the end of the sentence.\n\nCombining these elements in a coherent and grammatically correct order, the surface form of the sentence is:\n\n**Ayrıca meclisin fazla mesai yapması konusu da ele alınacak ifade ediliyor.**"

The verb \"var\" in the desiderative mood indicates a wish or desire, which can be translated as \"olsun\".\n3. The verb \"başla\" in the optative mood with a first-person plural subject translates as \"başlayalım\".\n4. The auxiliary verb \"mi\" is a question particle, so it remains \"mi\".\n5.
