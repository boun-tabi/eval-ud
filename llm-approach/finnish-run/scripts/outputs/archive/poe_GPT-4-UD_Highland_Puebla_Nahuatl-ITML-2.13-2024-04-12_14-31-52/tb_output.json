        "output": "The original form of the sentence, based on the provided lemmas and morphological features, could be constructed as follows:\n\n1. **ka** - This lemma indicates a relational noun. The specified possessive features (singular number, third person) suggest a form like \"his/her\".\n2. **se** - This is a determiner, which in Nahuatl can mean \"one\" or \"a/an\".\n3. **komit** - As a noun with a diminutive degree, this would typically be a smaller or affectionate form of a base noun.\n4. **ijkon** - This adverb might suggest a location or manner.\n5. **ilia** - This is a transitive verb in the present tense, with plural subject and singular object agreement in third person.\n6. **meliojkomit** - This noun is in absolutive case, which often is the direct object in transitive clauses.\n7. **.** - Punctuation to end the sentence.\n\nConsidering Nahuatl syntax, which typically follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) order and the relational noun's possessive nature, the sentence might be structured to reflect these characteristics. The verb \"ilia\" would likely come first due to its transitive nature, followed by the subject and then the object. However, the presence of an adverb (ijkon) could alter typical placement.\n\nHere is a plausible surface form:\n\n**Iliaj ijkon se komit ka meliojkomit.**\n\nExplanation:\n- **Iliaj** - Verb \"ilia\" conjugated for plural subject and singular third person object.\n- **ijkon** - Adverb modifying the verb.\n- **se komit** - \"A small thing\" acting as the subject.\n- **ka** - Relational noun \"his/her\", specifying ownership or relation to the object.\n- **meliojkomit** - Noun in absolutive case, the object receiving the action.\n- **.** - Sentence final punctuation.\n\nThis reconstruction is speculative, especially without specific conjugation rules and the exact form of the relational noun \"ka\". Adjustments might be needed depending on deeper linguistic knowledge of the specific Nahuatl variety.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"original_form\": \"Iliaj ijkon se komit ka meliojkomit.\"\n}\n```"
