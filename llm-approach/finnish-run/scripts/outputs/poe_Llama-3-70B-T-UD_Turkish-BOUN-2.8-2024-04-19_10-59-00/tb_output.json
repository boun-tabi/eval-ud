With the adposition \"sonra\" (meaning \"after\" or \"from\"), it forms a phrase \"kırktan sonra\", meaning \"after forty\" or \"from forty\".\n* The third token \"tempo\" is a noun in the nominative case, functioning as the subject of the sentence.\n* The fourth token \"inan\" is a verb in the habitual aspect, negated, and in the passive voice. It depends on the fifth token \"biçim\", which is a noun in the locative case. Together, they form a phrase \"inanılmayan bir biçim\", meaning \"an unbelievable form\" or \"a form that is not believed\".\n* The sixth token \"hız\" is the main verb of the sentence, in the habitual aspect, positive, and in the present tense. It agrees with the subject \"tempo\" in number and person.\n* The sentence is completed with the punctuation token \".\".\n\nPutting all the pieces together, we get the sentence \"Kırktan sonra tempo inanılmayan bir biçim hızlanır.\", which roughly translates to \"After forty, the tempo takes on an unbelievable form.\""

        "output": "Based on the provided linguistic features, I'll try to reconstruct the surface form of the sentence.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n1. The first token \"delik\" is a noun and depends on the second token \"kepçe\" as an adjectival modifier, so it's likely to be an adjective modifying \"kepçe\". In Turkish, this would be expressed as \"delik kepçe\".\n2. The second token \"kepçe\" is a noun and depends on the fourth token \"çık\" as an oblique argument or adjunct. This suggests that \"kepçe\" is the object of the verb \"çık\".\n3. The third token \"ile\" is a coordinating conjunction and depends on the second token \"kepçe\" as a case marker. In Turkish, \"ile\" is used to indicate the instrumental case, so it's likely to be \"kepçe ile\".\n4. The fourth token \"çık\" is a verb in the imperative mood, plural number, and second person. This suggests that the verb is in the form of \"çıkın\".\n5. The fifth token is a punctuation mark and depends on the fourth token \"çık\" as a punctuation mark.\n\nTaking these into account, I propose the following surface form of the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Delik kepçe ile çıkın.\"}\n\nPlease let me know if this is correct or if I need to make any adjustments!"

The first token \"nasıl\" is an adverb, so it remains as \"nasıl\".\n2. The second token \"ol\" is a verb in the desiderative mood, which is often translated to \"wish\" or \"want\". However, in this context, it seems to be used as a auxiliary verb to form a complex sentence. I'll come back to this later.\n3. The third token \"yine\" is an adverb, so it remains as \"yine\".\n4. The fourth token \"git\" is a verb in the habitual aspect, which is often translated to \"go\" or \"used to go\". Since it's in the first person singular, it becomes \"giderim\" (I go).\n5. The fifth token \"diye\" is an adposition, which is often translated to \"as\" or \"like\". In this context, it seems to be used to introduce a quotation or a manner, so it remains as \"diye\".\n6. The sixth token \"kadın\" is an adjective, but it's likely to be a noun in this context, meaning \"women\". Since it's in the nominative case and plural number, it remains as \"kadınlar\".\n7. The seventh token \"kendi\" is a pronoun, which is often translated to \"own\" or \"self\". In this context, it seems to be used as a reflexive pronoun, so it becomes \"kendini\" (himself/herself/itself).\n8. The eighth token \"koyver\" is the main verb, which is in the habitual aspect and third person plural. It's often translated to \"let\" or \"allow\". Since it's in the present tense, it remains as \"koyarlar\" (they let).\n9. The ninth token \"veee\" is a noun, but it's likely to be an interjection or an expression in this context. I'll keep it as \"veee\", although it might not be a common Turkish expression.\n10. The tenth token is a punctuation mark, which is a period at the end of the sentence.\n\nNow, let's combine these tokens to form the sentence:\n\n\"Nasıl ol yine giderim diye kadınlar kendi koyarlar veee.\"\n\nHowever, this sentence doesn't sound very natural in Turkish. The verb \"ol\" in the desiderative mood is often used to express a wish or a desire, so I'll try to rephrase the sentence to make it more natural:\n\n\"Nasıl ol yine giderim diye kadınlar kendilerini koyarlar veee.\"\n\nThis sentence can be translated to \"How do they let women go as they wish, and so on.\" or \"How do they allow women to go as they please, and so on.\" The sentence still sounds a bit awkward, but it's the best I could come up with given the provided linguistic features."

Here's my answer:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Bu sonuc yüzlerce İngilizce site gelmiş.\"}\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this answer:\n\n* The first token \"bu\" is a pronoun in the genitive case, which suggests it's a possessive pronoun. In Turkish, the possessive pronoun \"bu\" is often used as \"bu\" (this) or \"bu nun\" (of this). Given the context, I chose \"bu\" as the surface form.\n* The second token \"sonuç\" is a noun in the locative case, which suggests it's used to indicate a location or position. In Turkish, the locative case is often indicated by adding the suffix \"-da\" or \"-de\" to the noun. Given the context, I chose \"sonuç\" as the surface form, assuming it's used as a location.\n* The third token \"yüzlerce\" is a numeral, which suggests it's used to indicate a quantity. In Turkish, numerals are often used as adjectives to modify nouns. Given the context, I chose \"yüzlerce\" as the surface form, assuming it's used to modify the noun \"site\".\n* The fourth token \"İngilizce\" is an adjective, which suggests it's used to modify a noun. In Turkish, adjectives often come before the nouns they modify. Given the context, I chose \"İngilizce\" as the surface form, assuming it's used to modify the noun \"site\".\n* The fifth token \"site\" is a noun, which suggests it's the main subject of the sentence. Given the context, I chose \"site\" as the surface form.\n* The sixth token \"gel\" is a verb, which suggests it's the main action of the sentence. In Turkish, verbs often come at the end of sentences. Given the context, I chose \"gelmiş\" as the surface form, assuming it's in the perfect aspect and past tense.\n* The seventh token \".\" is a punctuation mark, which suggests it's used to indicate the end of the sentence. I ignored this token in the surface form.\n\nPutting it all together, I arrived at the surface form \"Bu sonuc yüzlerce İngilizce site gelmiş.\""

The second token \"kapı\" is a noun in the ablative case, which depends on the fourth token \"çık\" as an oblique argument or adjunct. This implies that \"kapı\" is the location from which something is exiting.\n3. The third token \"da\" is a coordinating conjunction that depends on the second token \"kapı\" as an emphasizing word or intensifier. This suggests that \"da\" is used to emphasize the location \"kapı\".\n4. The fourth token \"çık\" is a verb in the present tense, habitual aspect, with first-hand evidentiality, and positive polarity. Given the context, I think the verb should be in the form \"çıkıyor\" (exits or is exiting).\n5.

        "output": "Based on the provided linguistic features, I'll try to reconstruct the surface form of the sentence.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n1. The first token \"Ahmet\" is a proper noun in the genitive case, which suggests it's a possessive form. In Turkish, the genitive suffix for singular nouns is \"-in\" or \"-ın\". So, the surface form of the first token is \"Ahmet'in\".\n2. The second token \"geri\" is an adjective that depends on the fourth token with a clausal complement relation. This suggests that \"geri\" is a predicate adjective. In Turkish, predicate adjectives usually agree with the subject in number and person. Since the subject is \"Ahmet'in\" (singular, third person), the adjective \"geri\" should also be in the singular, third person form, which is \"geri\".\n3. The third token \"dön\" is a verb that depends on the second token with a compound relation. This suggests that \"dön\" is a part of a compound verb. In Turkish, the verb \"dön\" means \"to return\" or \"to turn back\". When combined with \"geri\", it forms the compound verb \"geri dön\", which means \"to turn back\" or \"to return back\".\n4. The fourth token \"karar\" is a verb that's the root token. It has a perfect aspect, which suggests that the verb is in the past tense. The verb \"karar\" means \"to decide\". With the perfect aspect, it becomes \"karar kıldım\" (I decided). However, the person and number features indicate that the subject is first person plural (we), so the correct form is \"karar kıldık\" (we decided).\n5. The fifth token is a punctuation mark, which is a period (.) at the end of the sentence.\n\nNow, let's put the tokens together to form the surface sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Ahmet'in geri dön kararı kıldık.\"}\n\nPlease note that this is my best attempt to reconstruct the sentence based on the provided linguistic features. The actual sentence may vary depending on the context and nuances of the Turkish language."

The possessor's number and person are both third person plural, suggesting that the sentence is talking about \"their regions\".\n* The second token \"ayrıl\" is a verb in the nominative case, but it's negated and in the present tense. The fact that it depends on the 6th token \"göç\" suggests that it's describing the göç (migration). The participle form of the verb suggests that it's being used as an adjective to describe the göç.\n* The third token \"bile\" is an adverb that modifies the verb \"ayrıl\", indicating that the separation is even more extreme.\n* The fourth token \"kır\" is an adjective in the ablative case, suggesting that it's describing the source of something. Given the context, it's likely that it's describing the \"bölgelerinden\" (from their regions).\n* The fifth token \"kent\" is a noun in the dative case, indicating that it's the indirect object of the sentence. It's likely that the göç (migration) is to this kent (city).\n* The sixth token \"göç\" is the root token, and it's a noun in the nominative case. It's the main subject of the sentence.\n* The seventh token \"et\" is a verb that depends on the \"göç\" token, suggesting that it's describing the göç. The perfect aspect and past tense suggest that the action of göç has been completed. The first-hand evidentiality suggests that the speaker has direct knowledge of the event.\n* The eighth token is a punctuation mark, indicating the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, I came up with the sentence \"Bölgelerinden bile kır kente göç etmişler...\". This sentence can be translated to \"They have even migrated from their broken regions to the city...\"."

The second token \"Çin\" is a proper noun in the genitive case, which suggests it's \"Çin'in\" (of China).\n3. The third token \"kuzey\" is a noun in the ablative case, which implies it's \"kuzeyinden\" (from the north).\n4. The fourth token \"gel\" is a verb in the progressive aspect, past tense, and plural number, which suggests it's \"geliyordu\" (were coming).\n5.

The second token \"insan\" (adverb) depends on the fourth token with an adverbial modifier relation. This is unusual, as \"insan\" typically means \"human\" or \"person\", not an adverb. However, considering the context, I'll assume it's being used as an adverb, perhaps meaning \"humanly\" or \"like a human\".\n3. The third token \"daha\" (adverb) also depends on the fourth token with an adverbial modifier relation. \"Daha\" typically means \"more\" or \"again\".\n4. The fourth token \"küçük\" (noun, nominative/direct case, singular number, third person, first person possessor) is the root token. Given the context, I'll assume it's a possessive noun, and the possessor is the first person singular. In Turkish, this would be expressed as \"my küçük\".\n5.

        "output": "Based on the provided linguistic features, I'll try to reconstruct the surface form of the sentence.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n1. The first token \"elma\" (noun, nominative/direct, singular, 3rd person) depends on the 2nd token with a possessive nominal modifier relation, so it's likely to be in the genitive case. The genitive form of \"elma\" is \"elmanın\".\n2. The second token \"dilim\" (noun, accusative, plural, 3rd person) is the possessed noun, and its possessor is the first token \"elma\". The accusative form of \"dilim\" is \"dilimlerini\".\n3. The third token \"tabak\" (noun, dative, plural, 3rd person) depends on the 4th token with an oblique argument or adjunct relation, so it's likely to be in the dative case. The dative form of \"tabak\" is \"tabaklara\".\n4. The fourth token \"bölüş\" (noun) is the root token, but it's unlikely to be a noun in this context. I'm going to take a guess that it's a verb \"bölüş-\" (to share) in the imperative mood, 2nd person singular. The imperative form of \"bölüş-\" is \"bölüş\".\n5. The fifth token is a punctuation mark, which doesn't affect the sentence's surface form.\n\nPutting it all together, I get:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Elmanın dilimlerini tabaklara bölüş.\"}\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible reconstruction, and the actual surface form might differ depending on the context and nuances of the Turkish language."

The third \"ne\" (coordinating conjunction) depends on the 8th token \"mavi\" with the dependency relation of preconjunct, which suggests another conjunction phrase.\n7. \"de\" (coordinating conjunction) depends on the 8th token \"mavi\" with the dependency relation of preconjunct, which reinforces the idea of a conjunction phrase.\n8. \"mavi\" (adjective) depends on the 5th token \"yeşil\" with the dependency relation of conjunct, which indicates it's part of a coordinated adjective phrase.\n9.

In Turkish, this would be \"Namağl\" (participial form of \"namağlamak\", meaning \"to be named\").\n* The second token \"tek\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"şampiyon\", so it should come before the noun.\n* The third token \"şampiyon\" is the root token, a singular noun in the nominative case.\n* The fourth token \":\" is a punctuation mark depending on the third token, which suggests it's a colon used to introduce a list or an explanation.\n* The fifth token \"Beşiktaş\" is a proper noun depending on the third token with a parataxis relation, which suggests it's providing additional information or an example related to the \"şampiyon\".\n\nPutting it all together, I get the sentence \"Namağl tek şampiyon: Beşiktaş\", which could be translated to \"The named single champion: Beşiktaş\"."

So, we get \"özgü ol\" which means \"in own\" or \"with own\".\n* The next token \"Sanskritçe\" is a proper noun, and it's an oblique argument or adjunct to the verb \"yaz\". It's likely that it's the language in which something is written.\n* The verb \"yaz\" is in the passive voice, past tense, and has a non-first hand evidentiality. It's likely that it means \"was written\".\n* The determiner \"bir\" modifies the noun \"destan\", which is the root token. The noun \"destan\" is a singular noun, and it's likely that it means \"epic\" or \"legend\".\n* The auxiliary verb \"i\" is a copula, and it's in the present tense, perfect aspect, and generalized modality. It's likely that it's used to form a possessive construction.\n* Finally, the punctuation mark \".\" depends on the root token \"destan\", indicating the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting it all together, we get \"Ramayanaya özgü Sanskritçe ol yazılan bir destanı\", which roughly translates to \"Ramayana's own epic written in Sanskrit\"."

The first token \"ben\" is a pronoun in the accusative case, which means it's the direct object.\n2. The second token \"din(I)\" is a verb, but it's not the main verb. It's a nominal modifier, so it's likely attached to the noun \"le\".\n3. The third and fifth tokens are punctuation marks \"-\", which are used to separate the compound noun \"din-le\".\n4. The fourth token \"le\" is a noun, and with the verb \"din(I)\" attached, it forms a compound noun \"din-le\".\n5. The sixth token \"mi\" is an auxiliary verb, which is used to form a question. It's attached to the noun \"le\".\n6. The seventh token is another punctuation mark \"-\", which is used to separate the compound noun \"din-le\" from the main verb.\n7. The eighth token \"yor\" is the main verb, and it's a noun.\n8. The ninth token \"!\" is a punctuation mark, which is used to indicate strong emotions or emphasis.\n9. The tenth token \"Yalova\" is a noun, and it's a conjunct attached to the main verb \"yor\".\n10. The eleventh token \"...\" is a punctuation mark, which is used to indicate a trailing off or uncertainty.\n\nBy combining these tokens in the correct order, we get the surface form of the sentence: \"Ben din-le mi yor Yalova!...\"."

The first token \"Tamam\" is an adjective and depends on the 5th token with a discourse element relation, so it's likely to be an adverbial phrase.\n2. The second token is a comma, which separates the adverbial phrase from the main clause.\n3. The third token \"dey\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, indicative mood, and present tense, and functions as an adverbial clause modifier. It's likely to be in the form of a converb (e.g., \"diyerek\" or \"deyip\").\n4. The fourth token \"görüşme\" is a verb in the dative case, singular number, and third person, and functions as a clausal complement. It's likely to be in the form of a verb in the dative case (e.g., \"görüşmeye\").\n5. The fifth token \"git\" is a noun, but it's unlikely to be a noun in this context. Given the context and the dependencies, it's more likely to be a verb \"git\" (to go) in the imperative mood.\n6. The sixth token is a period, which marks the end of the sentence.\n\nTaking these into account, I propose the following surface form of the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Tamam, diyerek görüşmeye git.\"}\n\nPlease note that Turkish sentence structure and morphology can be complex, and there might be alternative interpretations. However, based on the provided features, this is my best attempt to reconstruct the sentence."

The first token is \"ATATÜRK\", a proper noun, which is the root token.\n2. The second token is a comma, which depends on the 7th token with a punctuation relation. This suggests that the comma is used to separate the appositive phrase that follows.\n3. The third token is an opening quotation mark, which also depends on the 7th token with a punctuation relation. This indicates that the quotation mark is used to set off the phrase that follows.\n4. The fourth token is \"Türk\", an adjective, which depends on the 5th token with a possessive nominal modifier relation. This suggests that \"Türk\" is modifying the noun \"millet\".\n5. The fifth token is \"millet\", a noun, which depends on the 6th token with a possessive nominal modifier relation. This indicates that \"millet\" is possessed by the noun \"dil\".\n6. The sixth token is \"dil\", an adjective, which depends on the 7th token with a nominal subject relation. This suggests that \"dil\" is the subject of the sentence.\n7. The seventh token is \"Türkçe\", a noun, which depends on the 1st token with a parataxis relation. This indicates that \"Türkçe\" is in a paratactic relationship with \"ATATÜRK\", likely indicating that it's a language associated with Atatürk.\n8. The eighth token is a period, which depends on the 7th token with a punctuation relation. This suggests that the sentence ends with the noun \"Türkçe\".\n\nPutting it all together, I arrived at the surface form: \"ATATÜRK, \\\"Türk milleti dil\\\"i Türkçe.\""

I've placed it after \"at\" to create a coherent sentence structure.\n* The noun \"kent\" is in the genitive case, which suggests it's related to the possessive nominal modifier \"kıyılarına\" (genitive form of \"kıyı\"). I've placed it before \"kıyılarına\" to maintain a coherent sentence structure.\n* The noun \"kıyı\" is in the locative case, and the adposition \"ki\" marks the case. I've combined them to form the single word \"kıyılarına\".\n* The adverb \"daha\" modifies the adjective \"ucuz\", which in turn modifies the noun \"yerler\".

It depends on the 5th token as a direct object, so it should be in the accusative case. In Turkish, the accusative form of \"fırın\" is \"fırını\".\n* The second token \"önce\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, indicative mood, and present tense. It depends on the 5th token as an oblique argument or adjunct. In Turkish, \"önce\" is an adverb meaning \"before\" or \"previously\", so it should be used as such.\n* The third token \"125\" is a numeral, and it depends on the 4th token as a numeric modifier. It should be used as an attribute to the noun \"derece\".\n* The fourth token \"derece\" is a noun in the dative case, singular number, and third person. It depends on the 5th token as an oblique argument or adjunct. In Turkish, the dative form of \"derece\" is \"dereceye\", but since it's modified by the numeral \"125\", it becomes \"125 dereceye\".\n* The fifth token \"ısıt\" is a verb in the imperative mood, plural number, and second person. It's the root token, so it should be the main verb of the sentence. In Turkish, the imperative form of \"ısıt\" in the plural number and second person is \"ısıtın\".\n* The sixth token is a punctuation mark, which depends on the 5th token. It's a period at the end of the sentence.\n\nPutting all these tokens together, we get the surface form of the sentence: \"Fırını önce 125 derece ısıtın.\""

I've added the possessive suffix \"-in\" to \"et\" to form \"etinin\".\n* The 3rd token \"su\" is a noun in the ablative case, which often indicates movement away from something. I've added the possessive suffix \"-yun\" to \"su\" to form \"suyun\", which agrees with the singular possessor \"etinin\".\n* The 4th token \"çık\" is a verb in the causative voice, which often indicates causing something to happen. I've added the suffix \"-ması\" to \"çık\" to form \"çıkması\", which is a nominalized verb form.\n* The 5th token \"ez\" is a pronoun and the root token, which suggests it's the subject of the sentence. I've added the suffix \"-iliyor\" to \"ez\" to form \"eziliyor\", which agrees with the third person singular subject and indicates passive voice.\n* The 6th token is a punctuation mark, which I've added at the end of the sentence.\n\nPlease note that Turkish morphology can be complex, and there might be alternative ways to reconstruct the sentence.

The lemma \"yok\" means \"there is no\" or \"does not exist\", and the auxiliary verb \"i\" is likely to be the copula \"is\". In Turkish, the negation \"yok\" is often used with the copula \"var\" (to be) to form the negation \"yoktur\" (there is no).

Here's my answer:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Neden bilmem ama, Mahmut geldiğini ister.\"}\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this sentence:\n\n* The first token \"neden\" is an adverb, which depends on the second token \"bil\" (a verb) with an adverbial modifier relation. This suggests that \"neden\" is modifying the verb \"bil\".\n* The second token \"bil\" is a verb with a habitual aspect, singular number, first person, and negative polarity. This implies that the verb is in the present tense and has a negative form.\n* The third token \"ama\" is a coordinating conjunction, which depends on the seventh token \"iste\" (a verb) with a coordinating conjunction relation. This suggests that \"ama\" is connecting two clauses.\n* The fourth token \",\" is a punctuation mark, which depends on the seventh token \"iste\" with a punctuation relation. This implies that the comma is separating the two clauses.\n* The fifth token \"Mahmut\" is a proper noun, which depends on the sixth token \"gel\" (a verb) with a nominal subject relation. This suggests that \"Mahmut\" is the subject of the verb \"gel\".\n* The sixth token \"gel\" is a verb with a positive polarity, which depends on the seventh token \"iste\" with an open clausal complement relation. This implies that \"gel\" is a subordinate clause.\n* The seventh token \"iste\" is a verb with a non-first hand evidentiality, singular number, third person, positive polarity, and past tense. This suggests that \"iste\" is the main verb of the sentence.\n* The eighth token \".\" is a punctuation mark, which depends on the seventh token \"iste\" with a punctuation relation. This implies that the sentence ends with a period.\n\nBy combining these tokens and their dependencies, I arrived at the surface form \"Neden bilmem ama, Mahmut geldiğini ister.\""

The first token \"yıl\" (noun, nominative/direct, singular, third person) depends on the second token with a possessive nominal modifier relation, so it's likely to be in the genitive case. The genitive form of \"yıl\" is \"yılın\".\n2. The second token \"marş\" (noun, accusative, singular, third person) is the direct object of the verb \"söyle\" (token 3). The accusative form of \"marş\" is \"marşı\".\n3. The verb \"söyle\" (verb, dative, singular, third person) is in the dative case, which is unusual for a verb. However, considering the dependency relation with the fourth token \"başla\", it's possible that \"söyle\" is in the infinitive form \"söylemek\".\n4. The verb \"başla\" (verb, perfect aspect, first hand, plural, third person, positive) is the root token. In the past tense, the third person plural form of \"başla\" is \"başladılar\".\n5. The final token is a punctuation mark (period).\n\nTaking these forms into account, I propose the following surface form for the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Yılın marşı söylemek başladılar.\"}\n\nPlease note that Turkish morphology can be complex, and there might be alternative surface forms. However, based on the provided features, this seems like a plausible reconstruction."

The first token \"su\" (noun, nominative/direct, singular, third person) depends on the second token \"yer\" (noun, dative, singular, third person) with a possessive nominal modifier relation. This suggests that \"su\" is a possessive modifier of \"yer\", so the surface form should be \"su yer\" (meaning \"its place\" or \"the place of it\").\n2. The second token \"yer\" (noun, dative, singular, third person) depends on the fourth token \"dol\" (verb, imperative, singular, second person) with an oblique argument or adjunct relation. This suggests that \"yer\" is an indirect object of the verb \"dol\".\n3. The third token \"iyi\" (noun, instrumental, singular, third person) also depends on the fourth token \"dol\" with an oblique argument or adjunct relation. This suggests that \"iyi\" is an instrumental object of the verb \"dol\".\n4. The fourth token \"dol\" (verb, imperative, singular, second person) is the root token, and its surface form should be in the imperative mood, second person singular. The verb \"dol\" means \"fill\" in Turkish.\n5. The fifth token is a comma (punctuation) that depends on the fourth token \"dol\" with a punctuation relation.\n\nTaking all these into account, I propose the following surface form for the sentence:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Su yerine iyiyle dol!\"}\n\nThis translates to \"Fill its place with good!\" or \"Fill the place of it with good!\"."

The fifth token \"etken\" is a verb in the nominative case, which becomes \"etken\" in the surface form.\n6. The sixth token \",\" is a punctuation mark, which becomes \",\" in the surface form.\n7. The seventh token \"tanış\" is a noun, which becomes \"tanışılan\" in the surface form (with the suffix \"-lı\" indicating the possessive relationship).\n8. The eighth token \"kişi\" is a noun in the dative case, which becomes \"kişiye\" in the surface form.\n9. The ninth token \"sam\" is a noun in the accusative case, which becomes \"sam\" in the surface form.\n10.

This suggests that \"sırdaş\" is a conjunct of \"dost\", so they are separated by a comma.\n* The third token \"sırdaş\" is a noun and a conjunct of \"dost\".\n* The fourth token \"ve\" is a coordinating conjunction that depends on the sixth token \"komşu\". This suggests that \"ve\" connects \"sırdaş\" to \"komşu\".\n* The fifth token \"nihayet\" is an adverb that modifies the sixth token \"komşu\".\n* The sixth token \"komşu\" is a verb with a perfect aspect, plural number, and first-person singular agreement. It depends on the first token \"dost\" as a conjunct.\n* The seventh token is an ellipsis, which depends on the sixth token \"komşu\".

The fourth token \"gibiydi\" is a punctuation mark that depends on the third token, but it's unlikely to be a punctuation mark in the classical sense. Instead, I think it's a verb \"gibi\" (meaning \"like\" or \"as if\") in the past tense, which agrees with the aspect and tense features of the fifth token.\n5. The fifth token \"de\" is a verb in the perfect aspect, past tense, and third person singular, which suggests it should be in the form \"di\".\n6.

In Turkish, the genitive case is typically marked with the suffix \"-ın\" or \"-in\". So, the surface form of \"Üstün\" would be \"Üstünün\".\n2. \"tanı\" (verb, habitual aspect, singular, 3rd person, positive) is the root token. In Turkish, the habitual aspect is often marked with the suffix \"-r\" or \"-ır\". The verb \"tanı\" in the present tense, singular, 3rd person, and positive form would be \"tanır\".\n3. \"her\" (determiner) depends on the 4th token \"millet\" (noun) as a determiner. In Turkish, the determiner \"her\" typically means \"every\" or \"each\". It would come before the noun \"millet\".\n4. \"millet\" (noun, nominative, singular, 3rd person) depends on the 2nd token \"tanı\" (verb) as a nominal subject.

The second token \"bil\" is a verb in the progressive aspect, first person singular, present tense, and negative. Its surface form is likely \"bilmiyorum\" (with the negative suffix \"-miyor\" and the first person singular suffix \"-um\" attached).\n3.

        "output": "Based on the provided linguistic features, I'll try to reconstruct the surface form of the sentence. Here's my answer:\n\n{\"original_form\": \"Kalanı da bardak arasına bölüşüyor.\"}\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this answer:\n\n* The 1st token \"kalan\" is a noun in nominative case, singular number, and third person. It depends on the 2nd token \"don\" with a clausal modifier of noun relation, suggesting that \"kalan\" is the object of the verb \"don\". The verb \"don\" is in accusative case, singular number, and third person, which implies that the object \"kalan\" should be in accusative case as well. In Turkish, the accusative case for singular nouns is marked with the suffix \"-ı\" or \"-yı\" depending on the vowel harmony. Therefore, I added the suffix \"-ı\" to \"kalan\" to get \"kalanı\".\n* The 2nd token \"don\" is a verb in causative voice, which is not a typical verb form in Turkish. However, considering the context and the dependencies, I assumed that the verb \"don\" is actually \"dön\" (meaning \"to turn\" or \"to return\"), which is a common verb in Turkish. The causative voice suffix \"-dür\" or \"-dir\" is often used to form causative verbs in Turkish. Therefore, I added the suffix \"-dür\" to \"dön\" to get \"döndür\".\n* The 3rd token \"da\" is a coordinating conjunction that depends on the 2nd token \"don\" with an emphasizing word relation. In Turkish, \"da\" is often used to emphasize or add a sense of \"also\" or \"too\" to the preceding word or phrase.\n* The 4th token \"bardak\" is a noun in nominative case, plural number, and third person. It depends on the 5th token \"ara\" with a possessive nominal modifier relation, suggesting that \"bardak\" is the possessor of the adjective \"ara\".\n* The 5th token \"ara\" is an adjective in locative case, singular number, and third person. It depends on the 6th token \"bölüş\" with an oblique argument or adjunct relation, suggesting that \"ara\" is modifying the noun \"bölüş\". In Turkish, the locative case for singular adjectives is marked with the suffix \"-da\" or \"-de\" depending on the vowel harmony. Therefore, I added the suffix \"-na\" to \"ara\" to get \"arasına\".\n* The 6th token \"bölüş\" is a noun and the root token of the sentence. Considering the context and the dependencies, I assumed that the noun \"bölüş\" is actually \"bölüşme\" (meaning \"distribution\" or \"sharing\"), which is a common noun in Turkish.\n* The 7th token is a punctuation mark that depends on the 6th token \"bölüş\" with a punctuation relation, indicating the end of the sentence.\n\nBy combining these tokens and considering the linguistic features and dependencies, I arrived at the surface form \"Kalanı da bardak arasına bölüşüyor.\""
