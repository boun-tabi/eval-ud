Firstly, the company's technical support team provides the customer with a copy of NAS software on a CD. The customer then creates a new user account and changes the password. Next, the customer starts the software and clicks on the \"Install NAS\" option. The software walks the customer through the installation process, showing the screens for each step. Finally, the customer reboots the computer and logs into the NAS software to complete the installation process. The whole process takes about 30 minutes to complete. This information is useful for customers who are looking to install NASA on their computers, and provides them with step-by-step instructions for the process.\nReference(s):\n1.
