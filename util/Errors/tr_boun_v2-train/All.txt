If a language needs a relation subtype that is not documented in the universal guidelines, the relation
must have a language-specific documentation page in a prescribed format.
See https://universaldependencies.org/contributing_language_specific.html for further guidelines.
Documented dependency relations can be specifically turned on/off for each language in which they are used.
See https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_deprel.pl for details.

If a language needs a feature that is not documented in the universal guidelines, the feature must
have a language-specific documentation page in a prescribed format.
See https://universaldependencies.org/contributing_language_specific.html for further guidelines.
All features including universal must be specifically turned on for each language in which they are used.
