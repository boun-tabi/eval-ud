  "PRON": {

    "content": "PRON is used for English pronouns, such as we, her, it, who, and that when used as a relative pronoun.\n\nThe English PRON corresponds to the PTB PRP, PRP$, WP, WP$, EX, and certain things that are tagged DT or WDT (question and Wh pronouns, such as who, this, and that), when they comprise a nominal by themselves rather than functioning as the determiner of a nominal head (usually a noun).\n\nPersonal pronouns\n\nLemmas that differ from the inflected form are shown in brackets. (The accusative is lemmatized to match the nominative, and the independent possessive is lemmatized to match the dependent possessive.)\n\nVariant forms are italicized, with additional features described below the table.\n\nPronType=Prs* | Nominative<br> Case=Nom | Accusative<br> Case=Acc | Dependent<br> Possessive<br> Case=Gen, Poss=Yes | Independent<br> Possessive<br> Poss=Yes | Reflexive<br> Case=Acc, Reflex=Yes \n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- \nPerson=1, Number=Sing | I | me [I] | my | mine [my] | myself \nPerson=1, Number=Plur | we | us [we], ’s [we] | our | ours [our] | ourselves \nPerson=2 | you, u [you], ya | you, u [you], ya | your, ur [your], yo | yours [your] | \nPerson=2, Number=Sing | thou | thee [thou] | thy | thine [thy] | yourself, thyself\nPerson=2, Number=Plur | ye | y’all |  |   | yourselves \nPerson=3, Number=Sing, Gender=Masc | he | him [he] | his | his | himself \nPerson=3, Number=Sing, Gender=Fem | she | her [she] | her | hers [her] | herself \nPerson=3, Number=Sing, Gender=Neut | it | it | its | its | itself \nPerson=3, Number=Sing | one | one |  |  | oneself \nPerson=3, Number=Plur | they | them [they], ’em | their | theirs [their] | themselves \nXPOS (PTB) | PRP | PRP | PRP$ | PRP | PRP\n\n\\* Some reflexives (I myself am...) are PronType=Emp.\n\nIn the table, one is the use to refer to a generic individual (PRP in PTB); other uses are mentioned below. Genericity is not made explicit in the features.\n\nVariant forms associated with features (in addition to the features associated with the standard counterpart): \n  - Abbr=Yes: u, ur. As these are abbreviations, the lemma will reflect the standard spelling (you, your).\n  - Style=Arch: archaic forms ye, thou, thee, thy, thine, thyself (from Early Modern English) are retained in some idioms. These mark a combination of number and formality. The features only represent the number distinction. For you, your, etc., the modern, number-unspecified interpretation is assumed.\n  - Style=Coll: ya, ’em\n  - Style=Slng: yo\n  - Style=Vrnc: y’all\n\nThe contracted form of us in let’s is treated like other standard contractions (e.g. n’t), receiving the same lemma (we) and features as its noncontracted counterpart.\n\nRelative/interrogative (WH) pronouns\n\nThese are either PronType=Int (interrogative) or PronType=Rel (relative). PronType is the only feature except where shown below.\n\nWH | Plain | -ever | Possessive \n-- | -- | -- | -- \nwh.anim | who, whom (WP) | whoever, whomever (WP) | whose (WP$) \nwh.inanim | what, wtf (WP) | whatever (WP) | whose (WP$) \nwh.det | which (WDT) | whichever (WDT) |   \n\nRelative that is also considered a PRON in UD (XPOS WDT).\n\nThe table shows only PRON forms. Note that what, whatever, and which are tagged DET when functioning as det (WDT).\n\nThe variant wtf receives Style=Expr.\n\nTODO: whatever is sometimes DET+WDT even when not det\n\nTODO: tag whom(ever) for case; lemmatize whom as who and whomever as whoever\n\nTODO: add Case=Gen for whose\n\nTODO: exclamative what is PRON+WDT?\n\nIndefinite pronouns\n\nThese are NN in PTB but PRON in UD. A feature indicating the type of pronoun is provided as shown in the table below. These also receive the feature Number=Sing.\n\nINDEFINITE | one | body | thing\n-- | -- | -- | --\nPronType=Tot | everyone | everybody | everything\nPronType=Ind (any) | anyone | anybody | anything\nPronType=Ind (some) | someone | somebody | something\nPronType=Neg | no one | nobody | nothing\n\nNote that the Ind (indefinite) value of the PronType feature is narrower in UD than the general use of the term \"indefinite pronoun\": Ind specifically refers to the some- and any- varieties.\nThese two varieties are not currently distinguished with features.\n\nFor no one, written as two words, no is tagged as DET, and one is tagged as PRON with PronType=Neg. (It can also be spelled as one hyphenated word.)\n\nN.B. when, wherever, somewhere, etc. are tagged as ADV, not PRON.\n\nDemonstrative pronouns\n\nAlways DT in PTB, but UD uses PRON when these head a nominal.\n\nPronType=Dem | Number=Sing | Number=Plur\n-- | -- | --\nprox | this | these [this]\ndist | that | those [that]\n\nThe proximal/distal distinction is not encoded in features, but each corresponds to a unique lemma.\n\nNote that ADVs here and there also receive PronType=Dem.\n\nExpletive there\n\nExpletive there (EX) receives no features.\n\nBy contrast, it is considered a personal pronoun (PRP) even when functioning as expl.\n\nReciprocal pronouns\n\nReciprocal pronouns each other and one another receive the feature PronType=Rcp and are analyzed structurally with fixed.\n\nExamples with tags:\n\nThey saw each/DET other/ADJ\nfixed(each, other)\nobj(saw, each)\n\nThey saw one/PRON another/DET\nfixed(one, another)\nobj(saw, one)\n\nUses of one\n\nAccording to the PTB tagging guidelines, one should be\n\n- CD by default, even when not a prenominal modifier, e.g. one of the best reasons, BUT\n- a pronoun if referring to a generic individual (roughly 'a person'): see personal pronoun table above\n- NN(S) \"if it could be pluralized or modified by an adjective\", and in another one\n\nThese correspond to UPOS tags NUM, PRON, and NOUN, respectively.\nHowever, we depart from PTB in treating one as a pronoun in no one and one another, as described above."
