  "clf": {
    "shortdef": "classifier",
    "content": "A clf (classifier) is a word which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts.\nThe most canonical use is numeral classifiers, where the word is used with a number for counting objects.\nA classifier generally reflects some kind of\nconceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents.\nEtymologically, classifiers are normally historically nouns, and the words may still also be used as independent nouns,\nbut in their classifier use they have scant semantics left.\nIn most cases, the most appropriate UPOS to give classifiers will still be NOUN, though you may wish to give the words a feature\nindicating their special status as a classifier. (There is at present no Universal feature for classifiers, but NounType=Clf\nmight be apt.)\nThe clf function is intended for languages which have highly grammaticalized systems of classifiers.\nThe greatest density of such languages is in Asia.\nAs well as core classifiers, there are often also other words, sometimes called \"massifiers\" that are used in counting with\nsimilar behavior to classifiers. These typically include words for containers (\"cup\", \"box\") and units (\"month\", \"inch\"),\nsuch as Chinese 袋 ‘bag’ in 一袋米 [one bag rice] ‘a bag of rice’.\nIn a classifier language, it is usually most appropriate to also analyze these words as classifiers.\nMost other languages also count things with units, however, for these languages, such as English, clf is not used and rather\nstandard noun phrase relations are still used (despite there also being incipient grammaticalization in many cases, including English).\nSee the examples for English at the end.\n\nHere are some examples from Mandarin/Putonghua Chinese:\n\n* 三个学生 (三個學生) sān gè xuéshēng = “three students”, literally “three [human-classifier] student”\n* 三棵树 (三棵樹) sān kē shù = “three trees”, literally “three [tree-classifier] tree”\n* 三只鸟 (三隻鳥) sān zhī niǎo = “three birds”, literally “three [bird-classifier] bird”\n* 三条河 (三條河) sān tiáo hé = “three rivers”, literally “three [long-wavy-classifier] river”\n\nSyntactically, the classifier groups with the numeral rather than the noun and we therefore treat\nclassifiers as functional dependents of numerals (or possessives) using the new clf relation. (This\nis one of Greenberg’s universals and is true in almost all cases.\nA couple of exceptions are noted in Aikhenvald (2000: 105) Classifiers, OUP, but it is noticeable that in those languages\nthe putative head noun is in the genitive case.)\n\n<div class=\"sd-parse\">\nsān gè xuéshēng \\n three clf student\nnummod(xuéshēng, sān)\nclf(sān, gè)\n</div>\n\nSometimes a classifier is inserted between a demonstrative and a noun (instead of numeral and noun) [zh]:\n\n乘坐 這 輛 巴士 \\n Chéngzuò zhè liàng bāshì \\n Take this CLF bus\nobj(乘坐, 巴士)\ndet(巴士, 這)\nclf(這, 輛)\nobj(Chéngzuò, bāshì)\ndet(bāshì, zhè)\nclf(zhè, liàng)\nobj(Take, bus)\ndet(bus, this)\nclf(this, CLF)\n\nClassifier words also occur in various other constructions, and so it is important to distinguish the word in a particular\nlanguage from the universal classifier function proposed in UD. We go through here some further examples with Chinese classifiers.\n\nNo noun may appear with the number and classifier.\nIn this case, the classifier takes the role of the missing noun, and we promote the classifier to be the head.\nSo 我 買 兩 本 “I am buying two” is regarded as “I am buying two [books-CLF]”.\n\n我 買 兩 本 \\n I buy two CLF\nobj(買, 本)\nnummod(本, 兩)\n\nIn some languages, including Chinese, a classifier can also appear without a number, and frequently then has some sort of\ndeterminative function. We use the relation det for such uses of a classifier. For instance, in Cantonese ‘She bought a/the book’:\n\n佢 買 咗 本 書 \\n keoi maai zo bun syu \\n 3sg buy PERF CLF book\nobj(買, 書)\ndet(書, 本)\n\nFor languages without highly grammaticalized classifier systems, standard nominal modification relationships are used\neven when things are being counted in groups (with \"massifiers\"). For example, in English:\n\nthree cups of rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\ncase(oats, of)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)\n\nthree cups rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)"
