The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called absperson.\n* Person[erg] is the person of the ergative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called ergperson.\n* Person[dat] is the person of the dative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called datperson.\n\nOne may want to use just Person instead of Person[abs].\nHowever, there are two issues with that (at least in Basque).\nFirst, the absolutive argument is not always the subject. For transitive verbs, it is the object, so the parallelism with nominative-accusative languages would be weak anyway.\nSecond, we cannot avoid Number[abs] (both Number and Number[abs] can occur at one word)\nand thus we keep Person[abs] to demonstrate that it is the same layer of agreement for both the features."

Three to four dimensions of politeness are\ndistinguished in linguistic literature. The Polite feature currently covers\n(and mixes) two of them; a more elaborate system of feature values may be\ndevised in future versions of UD if needed. The two axes covered are:\n\n* speaker-referent axis (meant to include the addressee when he happens to be the referent)\n* speaker-addressee axis (word forms depend on who is the addressee, although the addressee is not referred to)\n\nChanging pronouns and/or person and/or number of the verb forms when respectable\npersons are addressed in Indo-European languages belongs to the speaker-referent\naxis because the honorific pronouns are used to refer to the addressee.\n\nIn Czech, formal second person has the same form for singular and plural, and\nis identical to informal second person plural. This involves both the pronoun\nand the finite verb but not a participle, which has no special formal form\n(that is, formal singular is identical to informal singular, not to informal plural).\n\nIn German, Spanish or Hindi, both number and person are changed (informal third\nperson is used as formal second person) and in addition, special pronouns are used\nthat only occur in the formal register ([de] Sie; [es] usted, ustedes;\n[hi] आप āpa).\n\nIn Japanese, verbs and other words have polite and informal forms but the polite\nforms are not referring to the addressee (they are not in second person). They\nare just used because of who the addressee is, even if the topic does not\ninvolve the addressee at all. This kind of polite language is called teineigo (丁寧語)\nand belongs to the speaker-addressee axis. Nevertheless, we currently use the\nsame values for both axes, i.e. Polite=Form can be used for teineigo too.\nThis approach may be refined in future."

The words should be annotated with\nthe Number feature in addition to NounClass, despite the fact that people\nwho know Bantu could infer the number from the noun class. The lemma of the\nnoun should be its singular form.\n\nThe set of values of this feature is specific for a language family or group.\nWithin the group, it is possible to identify classes that have similar meaning\nacross languages (although some classes may have merged or disappeared in\nsome languages in the group). The value of the NounClass feature consists\nof a short identifier of the language group (e.g., Bantu), and the number\nof the class (there is a standardized class numbering system accepted by\nscholars of the various Bantu languages; similar numbering systems should be\ncreated for the other families that have noun classes).\n\nList of noun classes in Swahili\n\n(from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nounclass)\n\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Class number</th>\n<th>Prefix</th>\n<th>Typical meaning</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><i>m-, mw-, mu-</i></td>\n<td>singular: persons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td><i>wa-, w-</i></td>\n<td>plural: persons (a plural counterpart of class 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><i>m-, mw-, mu-</i></td>\n<td>singular: plants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td><i>mi-, my-</i></td>\n<td>plural: plants (a plural counterpart of class 3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td><i>ji-, j-,</i> Ø-</td>\n<td>singular: fruits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td><i>ma-, m-</i></td>\n<td>plural: fruits (a plural counterpart of class 5, 9, 11, seldom 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td><i>ki-, ch-</i></td>\n<td>singular: things</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td><i>vi-, vy-</i></td>\n<td>plural: things (a plural counterpart of class 7)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td><i>n-, ny-, m-,</i> Ø-</td>\n<td>singular: animals, things</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td><i>n-, ny-, m-,</i> Ø-</td>\n<td>plural: animals, things (a plural counterpart of class 9 and 11)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td><i>u-, w-, uw-</i></td>\n<td>singular: no clear semantics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td><i>ku-, kw-</i></td>\n<td>verbal nouns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td><i>pa-</i></td>\n<td>locative meanings: close to something</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td><i>ku-</i></td>\n<td>indefinite locative or directive meaning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td><i>mu-, m-</i></td>\n<td>locative meanings: inside something</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>"

    "content": "Number[obj]\n\nFinite verbs in many Indo-European languages agree in person and number with their subject.\nSome languages in other families are head-marking, which means that the verbal morphology can cross-reference\nmultiple core arguments, not just the subject. If the cross-reference involves the Number of the argument,\nwe have two layers of Number on the verb: Number[subj], and (for transitive verbs) Number[obj].\n\nIn Basque (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypersonal_agreement\">polypersonal language</a>),\ncertain verbs overtly mark agreement with up to three arguments:\none in the absolutive case,\none in ergative and\none in dative.\nThus in dakarkiogu “we bring it to him/her”,\nakar is the stem (ekarri = “bring”),\nd stands for “it” (absolutive argument is the direct object of transitive verbs),\nki stands for the dative case,\no stands for “he” and\ngu stands for “we” (ergative argument is the subject of transitive verbs).\n\n* Number[abs] is the number of the absolutive argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called absnumber.\n* Number[erg] is the number of the ergative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called ergnumber.\n* Number[dat] is the number of the dative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called datnumber.\n\nOne may want to use just Number instead of Number[abs].\nHowever, there are two issues with that (at least in Basque).\nFirst, the absolutive argument is not always the subject. For transitive verbs, it is the object, so the parallelism with nominative-accusative languages would be weak anyway.\nSecond, and more important, some Basque finite verbs have additional morphemes of nominal inflection.\nThus their form reflects the person-number agreement with the absolutive argument (nor), and nominal inflection (case, number etc.) at the same time.\nExamples: dena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Sing),\ndituena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Plur|Number[erg]=Sing),\ndugunak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Sing|Number[erg]=Plur),\ndirenak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Plur).\nSo we reserve the Number feature for nominal inflection, and the Number[abs] feature for agreement.\n\nNote that we also define Person[abs] and Polite[abs], although there is no direct conflict for these features.\nBut it is better to have these features aligned with Person[erg], Polite[erg], Person[dat] and Polite[dat]."
