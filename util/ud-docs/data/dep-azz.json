    "content": "An appositional modifier of a noun is a nominal immediately following\nthe first noun that serves to define, modify, name, or describe that noun. It includes\nparenthesized examples, as well as defining abbreviations in one of\nthese structures.\n\nSam , my brother , arrived\nappos(Sam-1, brother-4)\n\nBill ( John 's cousin )\nappos(Bill-1, cousin-5)\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC )\nappos(Corporation-4, ABC-6)\n\nappos is intended to be used between two nominals. In general, modulo punctuation, the two halves of an apposition can be switched. \nFor example, you could also say My brother, Sam, arrived. There are somewhat similar constructions with titles \nwhere the title is less than a full nominal, such as state senator Paul Mnuchin, where reversal is impossible \nor would require insertion of a determiner to make a \nfull nominal. Some grammatical traditions, descending from Latin, call state senator in such cases a “fixed (or close) apposition” and take the name as the head. However, we seem to have only one nominal not two here. For example:\n\n> President Obama\n\n> \\*Obama President\n\n> state senator Paul Mnuchin\n\n> \\*Paul Mnuchin state senator\n\nappos should not be used in such cases. However, the examples can usually be rendered in a fuller form, corresponding to “loose (or wide) apposition” in the Latin tradition, where there are two full phrases. Then the relation appos is appropriate, for example:\n\nPaul Mnuchin , the senior Oregon state senator\nappos(Mnuchin-2, senator-8)\n\nAs is often the case, there are borderline cases. In formal writing, punctuation is usually a good signal of apposition, \nbut there are certainly cases of apposition where no punctuation is used:\n\nthe leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hassan Nasrallah\nappos(leader-2, Hassan-9)\nflat(Hassan-9, Nasrallah-10)\n\nGood tests include to ask whether the two halves are full nominals, whether the two halves can be swapped or not, and whether \nthere is case or agreement concord (in a language with rich morphology). So we have:\n\nI met the French actor Gaspard Ulliel\nnsubj(met-2, I-1)\ndet(actor-5, the-3)\namod(actor-5, French-4)\nobj(met-2, actor-5)\nappos(actor-5, Gaspard-6)\nflat(Gaspard-6, Ulliel-7)\n\nI met Gaspard Ulliel the French actor \nnsubj(met-2, I-1)\nobj(met-2, Gaspard-3)\nflat(Gaspard-3, Ulliel-4)\ndet(actor-7, the-5)\namod(actor-7, French-6)\nappos(Gaspard-3, actor-7)\n\nI met Gaspard Ulliel , the French actor \nnsubj(met-2, I-1)\nobj(met-2, Gaspard-3)\nflat(Gaspard-3, Ulliel-4)\npunct(Gaspard-3, ,-5)\ndet(actor-8, the-6)\namod(actor-8, French-7)\nappos(Gaspard-3, actor-8)\n\nI met French actor Gaspard Ulliel\nnsubj(met-2, I-1)\namod(actor-4, French-3)\nobj(met-2, actor-4)\nflat(actor-4, Gaspard-5)\nflat(actor-4, Ulliel-6)\n\nWhile items like abbreviations are generally reversable, the determiner test suggested above doesn't quite work there, since the determiner seems to belong with the main item:\n\nThe ABC ( Australian Broadcasting Corporation )\nappos(ABC-2, Corporation-6)\n\nIn the rare cases of more than one appositive nominal, all nouns should be marked as modifying the first noun, rather than being chained:\n\nSam , my brother , John 's cousin , arrived\nappos(Sam-1, brother-4)\nappos(Sam-1, cousin-8)\n\nNote however that nested apposition cannot be completely excluded. It may occur in combination with coordination:\n\nYou can choose between four subjects , language ( German or French ) , economy , technology and art .\nappos(subjects, language)\nconj(language, economy)\nconj(language, technology)\nconj(language, art)\ncc(art, and)\nappos(language, German)\nconj(German, French)\ncc(French, or)\n\nappos is also used to link key-value pairs in addresses, signature blocs, etc. (see also the list label):\n\nSteve Jones Phone: 555-9814 Email: jones@abc.edf\nflat:name(Steve-1, Jones-2)\nlist(Steve-1, Phone:-3)\nlist(Steve-1, Email:-5)\nappos(Phone:-3, 555-9814-4)\nappos(Email:-5, jones@abc.edf-6)"

Parataxis is a discourse-like equivalent of coordination, and so usually obeys an iconic ordering. Hence it is normal for the first part of a sentence to be the head and the second part to be the parataxis dependent, regardless of the headedness properties of the language.  But things do get more complicated, such as cases of parentheticals, which appear medially.\n\nLet 's face it we 're annoyed\nparataxis(Let, annoyed)\n\nThe guy , John said , left early in the morning\nparataxis(left, said)\npunct(said, ,-3)\npunct(said, ,-6)\n\nAn inventory of constructions to which parataxis has been applied\n\nThe following material is duplicated in the syntax overview.\n\nSide-by-side sentences (\"run-on sentences\")\n\nThe parataxis relation is used for a pair of what could have been standalone sentences, \nbut which are being treated together as a single sentence. This may happen because sentence\nsegmentation of the sentence was done primarily following the presence of sentence-final punctuation,\nand these clauses are joined by punctuation such as a colon or comma, or not delimited by punctuation\nat all. In a spoken corpus, it may happen because what is labeled as a sentence is more\ncommonly an utterance turn. Even if the treebanker is doing the sentence division, it may\nhappen because there seems to be a clear discourse relation linking two clauses. \nSometimes there are more than two sentences joined in this way. In this case we make all the later sentences\ndependents of the first one, to maximize similarity to the analysis used for conjunction.\n\nBearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food to move .\nparataxis(hunters, need)\npunct(need, ,)\n\nThis relation may happen with units that are smaller than sentences:\n\nDivided world the CIA\namod(world, Divided)\nparataxis(world, CIA)\ndet(CIA, the)\n\nPaired clauses with non-conjunction connective (\"X so Y\" etc.)\n\nThe relation is also used for clauses connected by a word like so, then, therefore, or however \nif neither clause is interpreted as modifying the other, and there is no coordinating conjunction:\n\nHe claimed to be a wizard ; however/ADV , he turned out to be a humbug .\nparataxis(claimed, turned)\nadvmod(turned, however)\n\nI 'm hungry , so/ADV I 'm getting a bagel .\nparataxis(hungry, getting)\nadvmod(getting, so)\n\nThe following, by contrast, are advcl modifiers:\n\nEat now so/ADV you wo n't be hungry later .\nadvcl(Eat, hungry)\nadvmod(hungry, so)\n\nIf/SCONJ you build it , then/ADV they will come .\nadvcl(come, build)\nmark(build, If)\nadvmod(come, then)\n\nNote that if-clauses should almost always be analyzed as subordinate, even when then is present.\n\nReported speech\n\nWhen a speech verb interrupts reported speech content, the interruption is treated as a parenthetical parataxis:\n\nThe guy , John said , left early in the morning\nparataxis(left, said)\npunct(said, ,-3)\npunct(said, ,-6)\n\nSee further discussion of reported speech at ccomp.\n\nNews article bylines\n\nWe have used the parataxis relation to connect the parts of a news article byline. \nThere does not seem to be a better relation to use.\n\nWashington ( CNN ) :\nparataxis(Washington, CNN)\npunct(CNN, ()\npunct(CNN, ))\npunct(CNN, :)\n\nInterjected clauses\n\nSingle word or phrase interjections are analyzed as discourse, but when a whole clause is interjected, we use the relation parataxis.\n\nCalafia has great fries ( they are to die for ! )\nparataxis(has, are)\npunct(are, ()\npunct(are, ))\n\nJust to let you all know Matt has confirmed the booking for 3rd Dec is OK .\nparataxis(confirmed, let)\n\nIn the second example, we treat the second half as the head of the dependency\nbecause the first half feels like a whole clause interjection, not like the main clause of the utterance.\n\nTag questions\n\nWe also use the parataxis relation for tag questions such as isn't it? or haven't you?.\n\nIt 's not me , is it ?\nparataxis(me, is)\npunct(is, ,)"

    "shortdef": "copula",
    "content": "A cop (copula) is the relation of a function word used to link a subject to a nonverbal predicate, including the expression of identity predication (e.g. sentences like \"Kim is the President\").\nIt is often a verb but nonverbal (pronominal) copulas are also frequent in the world's languages.\nVerbal copulas are tagged AUX, not VERB. Pronominal copulas are tagged PRON or DET.\n\nThe cop relation\nshould only be used for pure copulas that add at most TAME categories to the meaning of the predicate,\nwhich means that most languages have at most one copula, and only when the nonverbal predicate is treated\nas the head of the clause.\n\nAs a concrete example, in many European languages the equivalent of the English verb to be is the only word that can appear with the cop relation. In Spanish and related languages, both ser and estar can be copulas. In Czech and related languages, both být and bývat are copulas (because they are morphological variants of the same lexeme, and the reason they have two lemmas is that aspect-related morphology is treated as derivational in these languages). In contrast, the equivalents of to become are not copulas despite the fact that traditional grammar may label them as such. Existential to be can be copula only if it is the same verb as in equivalence clauses (John is a teacher). If a language uses two different verbs, then the existential one is not a copula. Some more discussion of the topic is archived here.\n\nBill is honest\nnsubj(honest, Bill)\ncop(honest, is)\n\nIvan is the best dancer\nnsubj(dancer-5, Ivan-1)\ncop(dancer-5, is-2)\ndet(dancer-5, the-3)\namod(dancer-5, best-4)\n\nThe copula be is not treated as the head of a clause, but rather the nonverbal predicate, as exemplified above.\n\nSuch an analysis is motivated by the fact that many languages often or always lack an overt copula in such\nconstructions, as in the the following Russian and Hebrew examples:\n\nIvan lučšij tancor \\n Ivan best dancer\nnsubj(tancor, Ivan)\namod(tancor, lučšij)\n\nani Kim \\n I am Kim\nnsubj(Kim-2, ani-1)\n\nIn informal English, this may also arise.\n\nEmail usually free if you have Wifi.\nnsubj(free, Email)\n\nThis analysis is adopted also when the predicate is a prepositional phrase, provided that the same copula\n(or absence thereof) is used here, in which case the nominal part of the\nprepositional phrase is the head of the clause.\n\nSue is in shape\nnsubj(shape, Sue)\ncop(shape, is)\ncase(shape, in)\n\nIf the copula is accompanied by other verbal auxiliaries for tense, aspect, etc., then they are also given a flat structure, and taken as dependents of the lexical predicate:\n\nSue has been helpful\nnsubj(helpful, Sue)\ncop(helpful, been)\naux(helpful, has)\n\nThe motivation for this choice is that this structure is parallel to the flat structure which we give to auxiliary verbs accompanying verbs. In particular, in languages such as English, it is often very difficult to decide whether to regard a participle as a verb or an adjective.  Perhaps the following sentence is such a case:\n\nThe presence of troops will be destabilizing .\nnsubj(destabilizing, presence)\ncop/aux(destabilizing, be)\naux(destabilizing, will)\n\nWhile a part of speech (and associated deprel: cop vs. aux) has to be decided in such cases, it would be unfortunate if the choice of part of speech also changed the dependency structure. Note, however, that the exact distribution of the copula construction is subject to language-specific variation.\n\nFinally, the cop may mark a predicate clause, i.e., a full clause serving as the predicate within an outer copular clause. \nIn such cases, nsubj:outer or csubj:outer can be used to distinguish the outer subject:\n\n-ROOT- The problem is that this has never been tried .\nnsubj:outer(tried, problem)\ncop(tried, is)\nmark(tried, that)\nnsubj:pass(tried, this)\naux(tried, has)\nadvmod(tried, never)\naux:pass(tried, been)\nroot(-ROOT-, tried)\n\nThe important thing is to keep calm .\nnsubj:outer(keep, thing)\ncop(keep, is)\nmark(keep, to)\nxcomp(keep, calm)"

It therefore attaches as ccomp—not only when integrated within the clause as an indirect quotation (said that...), but also when set off as a direct quotation, even with inverted order:\n\nHe said that he knew the muffin man .\nccomp(said, knew)\n\nI asked : \" Do you know the muffin man ? \"\nccomp(asked, know)\n\n\" Do you know the muffin man ? \" I asked .\nccomp(asked, know)\n\n\" I had hoped to remain anonymous , \" said the muffin man , who was tracked down Sunday at his home on Drury Lane .\nccomp(said, hoped)\nnsubj(said, man)\n~\n\nQuoted content is considered to be ccomp even if it is a sentence fragment:\n\n\" Three/NUM muffins/NOUN , \" he answered .\nnummod(muffins, Three)\nccomp(answered, muffins)\n\nIf the speech verb interrupts the reported speech content, parataxis is used instead. The speech verb attaches to the root of the reported speech (all in the following example):\n\n\" Three muffins , \" he answered , \" are all that I need today . \"\nparataxis(all, answered)\nnsubj(all, muffins)\n\nWeapons of mass destruction , the report explained , are designed to target civilian populations .\nparataxis(designed, explained)\nnsubj:pass(designed, Weapons)\n\nthe impact that the group 's practices , law enforcement officials say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect\nacl:relcl(impact, having)\nnsubj(having, practices)\nparataxis(having, say)\n\nChanged: \n- In earlier versions of SD/USD, complement clauses with nouns like fact or report were also analyzed as ccomp. However, we now analyze them as acl. Hence, ccomp does not appear in nominals. This makes sense, since nominals normally do not take core arguments.\n- The policy for copular constructions with a full clause as predicate has been changed to no longer use ccomp to nest the predicate clause under the copula."

  "clf": {
    "shortdef": "classifier",
    "content": "A clf (classifier) is a word which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts.\nThe most canonical use is numeral classifiers, where the word is used with a number for counting objects.\nA classifier generally reflects some kind of\nconceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents.\nEtymologically, classifiers are normally historically nouns, and the words may still also be used as independent nouns,\nbut in their classifier use they have scant semantics left.\nIn most cases, the most appropriate UPOS to give classifiers will still be NOUN, though you may wish to give the words a feature\nindicating their special status as a classifier. (There is at present no Universal feature for classifiers, but NounType=Clf\nmight be apt.)\nThe clf function is intended for languages which have highly grammaticalized systems of classifiers.\nThe greatest density of such languages is in Asia.\nAs well as core classifiers, there are often also other words, sometimes called \"massifiers\" that are used in counting with\nsimilar behavior to classifiers. These typically include words for containers (\"cup\", \"box\") and units (\"month\", \"inch\"),\nsuch as Chinese 袋 ‘bag’ in 一袋米 [one bag rice] ‘a bag of rice’.\nIn a classifier language, it is usually most appropriate to also analyze these words as classifiers.\nMost other languages also count things with units, however, for these languages, such as English, clf is not used and rather\nstandard noun phrase relations are still used (despite there also being incipient grammaticalization in many cases, including English).\nSee the examples for English at the end.\n\nHere are some examples from Mandarin/Putonghua Chinese:\n\n* 三个学生 (三個學生) sān gè xuéshēng = “three students”, literally “three [human-classifier] student”\n* 三棵树 (三棵樹) sān kē shù = “three trees”, literally “three [tree-classifier] tree”\n* 三只鸟 (三隻鳥) sān zhī niǎo = “three birds”, literally “three [bird-classifier] bird”\n* 三条河 (三條河) sān tiáo hé = “three rivers”, literally “three [long-wavy-classifier] river”\n\nSyntactically, the classifier groups with the numeral rather than the noun and we therefore treat\nclassifiers as functional dependents of numerals (or possessives) using the new clf relation. (This\nis one of Greenberg’s universals and is true in almost all cases.\nA couple of exceptions are noted in Aikhenvald (2000: 105) Classifiers, OUP, but it is noticeable that in those languages\nthe putative head noun is in the genitive case.)\n\n<div class=\"sd-parse\">\nsān gè xuéshēng \\n three clf student\nnummod(xuéshēng, sān)\nclf(sān, gè)\n</div>\n\nSometimes a classifier is inserted between a demonstrative and a noun (instead of numeral and noun) [zh]:\n\n乘坐 這 輛 巴士 \\n Chéngzuò zhè liàng bāshì \\n Take this CLF bus\nobj(乘坐, 巴士)\ndet(巴士, 這)\nclf(這, 輛)\nobj(Chéngzuò, bāshì)\ndet(bāshì, zhè)\nclf(zhè, liàng)\nobj(Take, bus)\ndet(bus, this)\nclf(this, CLF)\n\nClassifier words also occur in various other constructions, and so it is important to distinguish the word in a particular\nlanguage from the universal classifier function proposed in UD. We go through here some further examples with Chinese classifiers.\n\nNo noun may appear with the number and classifier.\nIn this case, the classifier takes the role of the missing noun, and we promote the classifier to be the head.\nSo 我 買 兩 本 “I am buying two” is regarded as “I am buying two [books-CLF]”.\n\n我 買 兩 本 \\n I buy two CLF\nobj(買, 本)\nnummod(本, 兩)\n\nIn some languages, including Chinese, a classifier can also appear without a number, and frequently then has some sort of\ndeterminative function. We use the relation det for such uses of a classifier. For instance, in Cantonese ‘She bought a/the book’:\n\n佢 買 咗 本 書 \\n keoi maai zo bun syu \\n 3sg buy PERF CLF book\nobj(買, 書)\ndet(書, 本)\n\nFor languages without highly grammaticalized classifier systems, standard nominal modification relationships are used\neven when things are being counted in groups (with \"massifiers\"). For example, in English:\n\nthree cups of rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\ncase(oats, of)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)\n\nthree cups rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)"

    "shortdef": "indirect object",
    "content": "| | WARNING |\n|-----------|--------|\n| ⚠️ | The traditional term \"indirect object\", associated with morphosyntactic encoding of certain types of arguments (especially datives/recipients) in a clause, has a wide range of interpretations across languages and linguistic frameworks. In UD, universal-level relations do not distinguish arguments and adjuncts; rather, the distinction is between core arguments and oblique modifiers. iobj must only be used for core arguments, never for obliques, as described below. The naming of this relation may be changed in the next major revision of the UD guidelines. |\n\nIn UD, the indirect object of a verb is any nominal phrase that is a core\nargument of the verb but is not its subject or (direct) object.\nThe prototypical example is the recipient of ditransitive verbs of\nexchange:\n\nShe gave me a raise\niobj(gave, me)\nnsubj(gave, She)\n\nHowever, many languages allow other semantic roles as additional objects. The most common case is allowing benefactives, but some languages allow other roles. Examples include instruments, such as in the Kinyarwanda example below, or comitatives. At the other extreme, some languages lack all indirect objects.\n\nUmukoóbwa a-ra-andik-iish-a íbárúwa íkárámu \\n girl 1-PRS-write-APPL-ASP letter pen\nobj(a-ra-andik-iish-a, íbárúwa)\niobj(a-ra-andik-iish-a, íkárámu)\n\nIn languages distinguishing morphological cases, the recipient will often be marked by the dative case.\nHowever, the iobj relation can be used only for a core argument. The morphological dative may signal a core argument\nin some languages (such as Basque) but in many others it is just oblique (like the English preposition to). For\ninstance, in many Indo-European languages, the recipient should be attached as obl and not iobj, regardless\nof the traditional grammar which may label it as “indirect object”.\n\nIn the following Czech example, the verb takes two objects. Both are nouns in the accusative case, which is rather\nunusual—for most other verbs, one of the arguments would be in the dative and would thus be treated as oblique in UD.\nHowever, a bare accusative signals a core object and a verb with one nominative and two accusatives is ditransitive\nin UD. One of the accusatives is direct object (patient), the other is indirect (recipient). It is parallel to how\nthe English translation would be annotated (where there is no morphological case marking) and also to verbs of giving\nin English (consider a similar sentence, he gave my daughter a class of maths).\n\nOn učí mou dceru matematiku . \\n He teaches my daughter.Acc maths.Acc .\nobj(učí, matematiku)\niobj(učí, dceru)\nobj(teaches, maths.Acc)\niobj(teaches, daughter.Acc)\n\nPredicates in Basque can cross-reference (by morphological agreement on the auxiliary verb) up to three arguments\nin different morphological cases: ergative, absolutive, and dative. The morphological cross-reference is a strong\nindicator that all three are core arguments. Therefore, if all three are present, we have a double-object situation\nand the dative argument will be iobj (while the ergative argument will be nsubj and the absolutive obj).\nEven if the absolutive argument is omitted for a verb which licenses three arguments, the dative argument is still\niobj.\n\n(Nik)/Case=Erg (zuri)/Case=Dat liburua/Case=Abs eman dizut . \\n (I) (you) book given I-have-you-it .\nnsubj(eman, (Nik))\niobj(eman, (zuri))\nobj(eman, liburua)\naux(eman, dizut)\npunct(eman, .-6)\nnsubj(given, (I))\niobj(given, (you))\nobj(given, book)\naux(given, I-have-you-it)\npunct(given, .-13)\n\nMariari/Case=Dat eman nion liburua/Case=Abs . \\n To-Maria given I-have-her-it book .\niobj(eman, Mariari)\nobj(eman, liburua)\naux(eman, nion)\npunct(eman, .-5)\niobj(given, To-Maria)\nobj(given, book)\naux(given, I-have-her-it)\npunct(given, .-11)\n\nMariari/Case=Dat eman nion . \\n To-Maria given I-have-her-it .\niobj(eman, Mariari)\naux(eman, nion)\npunct(eman, .-4)\niobj(given, To-Maria)\naux(given, I-have-her-it)\npunct(given, .-9)\n\nLiburua/Case=Abs eman nion . \\n Book given I-have-her-it .\nobj(eman, Liburua)\naux(eman, nion)\npunct(eman, .-4)\nobj(given, Book)\naux(given, I-have-her-it)\npunct(given, .-9)\n\nNevertheless, Basque has also a class of verbs that license only two core arguments, one ergative and\none dative. Here the ergative has the A function and the dative the P function (Zúñiga and Fernández 2014),\nmeaning that the dative is obj rather than iobj, as in “The teacher has looked angrily at the students.”\n\nIrakasleak/Case=Erg haserre begiratu die ikasleei/Case=Dat . \\n Teacher angrily looked he-has-them to-students .\nnsubj(begiratu, Irakasleak)\nadvmod(begiratu, haserre)\naux(begiratu, die)\nobj(begiratu, ikasleei)\npunct(begiratu, .-6)\nnsubj(looked, Teacher)\nadvmod(looked, angrily)\naux(looked, he-has-them)\nobj(looked, to-students)\npunct(looked, .-13)\n\nAnother class of transitive verbs in Basque license one dative and one absolutive argument. Here the\ndative has the A function and the absolutive the P function, meaning that the dative is nsubj and\nthe absolutive is obj, as in “The boy likes the soup very much.”\n\nZopa/Case=Abs izugarri gustatzen zaio mutilari/Case=Dat . \\n Soup greatly pleasing it-is-him to-boy .\nobj(gustatzen, Zopa)\nadvmod(gustatzen, izugarri)\naux(gustatzen, zaio)\nnsubj(gustatzen, mutilari)\npunct(gustatzen, .-6)\nobj(pleasing, Soup)\nadvmod(pleasing, greatly)\naux(pleasing, it-is-him)\nnsubj(pleasing, to-boy)\npunct(pleasing, .-13)\n\nIn Tagalog, core arguments are marked by the prepositions ang and ng (or by corresponding inflection\nof personal pronouns), while oblique dependents are typically marked by the preposition sa (sometimes\nglossed as the dative). Giving somebody something is a (mono)transitive predicate.\n\n* Nagbigay ang lalaki ng libro sa babae. “The man gave a book to the woman.” (agent voice)\n\n~~~ conllu\ntext = Nagbigay ang lalaki ng libro sa babae.\ntext_en = The man gave a book to the woman.\n1\tNagbigay\tbigay\tVERB\t\tAspect=Perf|Mood=Ind|VerbForm=Fin|Voice=Act\t0\troot\t\tGloss=gave\n2\tang\tang\tADP\t\tCase=Nom\t3\tcase\t\tGloss=the\n3\tlalaki\tlalaki\tNOUN\t\t\t1\tnsubj\t_\tGloss=man\n4\tng\tng\tADP\t\tCase=Gen\t5\tcase\t\t_\n5\tlibro\tlibro\tNOUN\t\t\t1\tobj\t_\tGloss=book\n6\tsa\tsa\tADP\t\tCase=Dat\t7\tcase\t\tGloss=DIR\n7\tbabae\tbabae\tNOUN\t\t\t1\tobl\t_\tGloss=woman|SpaceAfter=No\n8\t.\t.\tPUNCT\t\t\t1\tpunct\t_\tGloss=.\n\n~~~\n\nHowever, locative dependents can be topicalized if the verb morphology signals\nthe “locative voice”. Then the locative noun phrase switches to nominative,\nit becomes a core argument, while the original two core arguments keep core\ncoding, too. Therefore we have a ditransitive clause with three core arguments,\neven for verbs that are not associated with ditransitives in other languages:\n\n* Aalisan ng babae ng bigas ang sako para sa bata. “A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.” (locative voice)\n\n~~~ conllu\nsent_id = 3.111c/tl\ntext = Aalisan ng babae ng bigas ang sako para sa bata.\ngloss = FUT-take.out-DP ACT woman OBJ rice PIV sack BEN child\ntext_en = A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.\nDP = directional pivot; PIV = pivot marker\n1\tAalisan\talis\tVERB\t\tAspect=Prog|Mood=Ind|VerbForm=Fin|Voice=Lfoc\t0\troot\t\tGloss=will-take-out|MSeg=a-alis-an|MGloss=FUT-take.out-DP\n2\tng\tng\tADP\t\tCase=Gen\t3\tcase\t\t_\n3\tbabae\tbabae\tNOUN\t\t\t1\tiobj:agent\t_\tGloss=woman\n4\tng\tng\tADP\t\tCase=Gen\t5\tcase\t\t_\n5\tbigas\tbigas\tNOUN\t\t\t1\tobj:patient\t_\tGloss=rice\n6\tang\tang\tADP\t\tCase=Nom\t7\tcase\t\tGloss=the\n7\tsako\tsako\tNOUN\t\t\t1\tnsubj:loc\t_\tGloss=sack\n8\tpara\tpara\tADP\t\t\t10\tcase\t_\tGloss=for\n9\tsa\tsa\tADP\t\tCase=Dat\t10\tcase\t\tGloss=BEN\n10\tbata\tbata\tNOUN\t\t\t1\tobl\t_\tGloss=child|SpaceAfter=No\n11\t.\t.\tPUNCT\t\t\t1\tpunct\t_\tGloss=.\n\n~~~\n\nIn Plains Cree (Wolvengrey 2011), transitive verbs cross-reference subjects and animate objects but not\ninanimate objects. With a verb of giving, the theme is typically inanimate while the recipient is\ntypically animate. Assuming that nsubj and obj are reserved for the two core arguments\ncross-referenced by the verb, the theme has to be iobj (if it is a core argument at all; otherwise\nit would have to be obl; but real oblique nominals in Plains Cree take a locative case affix,\nwhich is not present here).\n\n* Nikī-miyāw anima masinahikan. “I gave him that book.”\n\n~~~ conllu\ntext = Nikī-miyāw anima masinahikan.\ntext_en = I gave him/her that book.\n1\tNikī-miyāw\tmiy\tVERB\t\tAnimacy=Anim|Mood=Ind|Number[high]=Sing|Number[low]=Sing|Person[high]=1|Person[low]=3|Tense=Past|Voice=Dir\t0\troot\t\tGloss=I-gave-him/her|MSeg=ni-kī-miy-ā-w|MGloss=1-PAST-give.to-DIR-3SG\n2\tanima\tanima\tDET\t\tAnimacy=Inan|Number=Sing|PronType=Dem\t3\tdet\t\tGloss=that|MGloss=DEM.0's\n3\tmasinahikan\tmasinahikan\tNOUN\t\tAnimacy=Inan|Number=Sing\t1\tiobj\t\tGloss=book|SpaceAfter=No\n4\t.\t.\tPUNCT\t\t\t1\tpunct\t_\tGloss=.\n\n~~~\n\nIn the above example, the verb stem used is for animate objects, while\nmasinahikan “book” is inanimate. That is a proof that the 3rd person singular\ncross-reference on the verb does not refer to the book but to an animate\nrecipient that is not overtly represented in the sentence.\n\nIf the language has a prototypical iobj (occurring in a double object construction with obj),\nthen morphosyntactic criteria need to be established for when a sole object is obj and when it is iobj.[^1]\nDepending on the language, potential reasons to consider a sole object in a clause as an iobj include:\n- It has case marking distinct from that of a prototypical obj, e.g. dative rather than accusative\n- Another, more patient-like object may be inserted into the clause without affecting the morphosyntax of the object in question\n- The verb licenses the object in combination with a ccomp (the ccomp may be analyzed as taking the place of an obj)\n\nFor example, in English, the verb teach may occur with obj, iobj, or both:\n\nShe teaches the students introductory logic .\niobj(teaches, students)\nobj(teaches, logic)\n\nShe teaches introductory logic .\nobj(teaches, logic)\n\nShe teaches the first-year students .\niobj(teaches, students)\n\nShe teaches her students that good writing is important .\niobj(teaches, students)\nccomp(teaches, important)\n\nShe teaches her students to write well .\niobj(teaches, students)\nxcomp(teaches, write)\n\nHowever, not all verbs license two objects (or an object plus ccomp), in which case the sole object should be plain obj even if it has recipient-like semantics:\n\nShe questions her students about their interests .\nobj(questions, students)\nobl(questions, interests)\n\nShe helps her students to succeed .\nobj(helps, students)\nxcomp(helps, succeed)\n\n^1]: This is an amended policy as described [on the changes page.\n\nReferences\n\n* Fernando Zúñiga, Beatriz Fernández (draft 26.6.2014): Grammatical relations in Basque\n* Arok Elessar Wolvengrey (2011):\n  Semantic and pragmatic functions in Plains Cree syntax\n  (PhD thesis).

In particular, when the list is written as a single sentence, with commas and overt coordination, then it should be analyzed as a coordinated structure.\n\nFor list items, the de facto decision taken in issue 156 is that, for enumerated lists, regardless of whether the items are numbered with arabic, roman, or other numerals, or are given letters, we will regard the item contents as the head, and the item enumerator will be a nummod of it and given the part of speech NUM. Any punctuation with the list item will be a punct dependent of the item enumerator. For itemized lists with bullet, dash or similar markers, the current standard is to give the marker a PUNCT part of speech and then to give it the dependency relation punct to the head of the item content."

    "content": "This relation captures expletive or pleonastic nominals. These are nominals that appear in an argument position of a predicate but which do not themselves satisfy any of the semantic roles of the predicate. The main predicate of the clause (the verb or predicate adjective or noun) is the governor. In English, this is the case for some uses of it and there: the existential there, and it when used in extraposition constructions.  (Note that both it and there also have non-expletive uses.)\n\nThere is a ghost in the room\nexpl(is, There)\n\nIt is clear that we should decline .\nexpl(clear, It)\n\nSome languages do not have expletives of the English sort, including most languages with free pro-drop (the ability to use zero anaphora rather than overt pronouns). In languages with expletives of this sort, they can be positioned where normally a core argument appears: the subject and direct object (and even indirect object) slots, as in the examples below. Note that in the analysis of these examples, we treat the postposed subject or clausal argument as a regular core argument, and mark the expletive with expl.\n\nThere is a ghost in the room\nexpl(is, There)\nnsubj(is, ghost)\nobl(is, room)\n\nI believe there to be a ghost in the room\nnsubj(believe, I)\nexpl(believe, there)\nxcomp(believe, be)\nnsubj(be, ghost)\nobl(be, room)\n\nIt is clear that we should decline .\nexpl(clear, It)\ncsubj(clear, decline)\n\nThat we should decline is clear .\ncsubj(clear, decline)\n\nI mentioned it to Mary that Sue is leaving\nnsubj(mentioned, I)\nexpl(mentioned, it)\nobl(mentioned, Mary)\nccomp(mentioned, leaving)\n\nA second, related, use of the expl relation is for cases of true clitic doubling.  For languages in which clitics and lexical nominals are usually in complementary distribution – languages, such as French, which obey \"Kayne's generalization\" – then whichever of a clitic or a lexical nominal occurs will get the appropriate role, such as obj or iobj. In such languages, when doubling does occur, such as in spoken French, the right analysis is to regard the lexical nominal as dislocated (see the examples there). As such, the analysis will be the same as when a noun phrase doubles another noun phrase or a regular pronoun that fills a nominal argument position. However, other languages, such as Greek and Bulgarian, standardly allow doubling of a lexical nominal and a pronominal clitic, with the former still appearing in its regular role as an argument of the predicate. In these cases, if only one of the lexical nominal and the clitic appear in a clause, then whichever appears will be given the grammatical role of obj, iobj, etc. – parallel to the treatment of lexical nominals and pronouns in other languages, modulo the clitic pronoun having a different position in the sentence.  However, if both occur, the lexical nominal will be given the grammatical role of obj, iobj, etc., and the clitic will be treated as a pronominal copy, which does not receive its own semantic role, and hence will get the role expl. Modulo the different word order, this is fairly parallel to the treatment of it and there in English mentioned above, where another phrase satisfies the semantic role of the predicate. Examples from Greek and Bulgarian follow:\n\nΤης τον έδωσε της Καίτης τον αναπτήρα \\n PRON.Fem.Gen PRON.Masc.Acc gave ART.Fem.Gen Keti.Gen ART.Masc.Acc lighter.Acc\nexpl(έδωσε, Της-1)\niobj(έδωσε, Καίτης)\ndet(Καίτης, της-4)\nexpl(έδωσε, τον-2)\nobj(έδωσε, αναπτήρα)\ndet(αναπτήρα, τον-6)\n\nMarija mu izprati pismo na rabotnika \\n Maria 3.S.M.IO sent letter to the.worker\nexpl(izprati, mu)\nobj(izprati, pismo)\niobj(izprati, rabotnika)\ncase(rabotnika, na)\n\nReflexives\n\nThe expletive relation is also used for reflexive pronouns (see the feature u-feat/Reflex)\nattached to inherently reflexive verbs, i.e. verbs that cannot occur without the reflexive\npronoun and thus the pronoun does not play the role of a normal object\n(otherwise it would be possible to substitute it with an irreflexive pronoun or other nominal).\n\nUD recognizes several functions of reflexive pronouns (clitics) that are usually distinguished with the help of subtypes\nof the expl relation (see also the report from the 2015 Uppsala discussion of clitics where\nthis approach was approved):\n\n* expl:pv for reflexive clitics attached to inherently reflexive verbs (also called pronominal verbs in some grammars)\n* expl:pass for reflexive clitics attached to transitive verbs and acting as a voice marker (passive or mediopassive)\n* expl:impers for impersonal usage (works also with intransitive verbs)\n\nA Czech example:\n\nMartin se bojí zvířat . \\n Martin REFLEX fears animals .\nexpl:pv(bojí, se)\nexpl:pv(fears, REFLEX)\n\nFurther general discussion of expletives can be found in Postal, P. M., and G. K. Pullum (1988) “Expletive Noun Phrases in Subcategorized Positions,” Linguistic Inquiry 19(4): 635–670. The status of clitic doubling, and arguments for the lexical nominal being an argument with the clitic a kind of pronominal copy, appear inter alia in Boris Harizanov (2014) Clitic doubling at the syntax-morphology interface: A-movement and morphological merger in Bulgarian.

It is thus possible to preserve\nthe notion of object as it is defined in the traditional grammar of some\nlanguages, where it essentially follows the distinction between arguments and\nadjuncts (which is otherwise not reflected in the main UD relation types — see the\ndiscussion here).\nA Czech example:\n\nSpoléhám se na jeho instinkt . \\n I-rely REFL on his instinct .\nobl:arg(Spoléhám, instinkt)\nobl:arg(I-rely, instinct)\ncase(instinkt, na)\ncase(instinct, on)\n\nArguments are selected by the predicate. Their coding (preposition and\nmorphological case) is determined by the predicate; within the set of\narguments of this predicate, the coding maps the argument to a particular\nsemantic role.\nIn contrast, the semantics of an adjunct is relatively independent of the\npredicate, and typical adjuncts (such as specifications of time, location,\nmanner or instrument) can combine with a large number of different predicates.\n\nHence in the above example, the preposition na “on” and the accusative case of\nthe noun instinkt “instinct” are selected by the verb spoléhat “to rely”.\nOther verbs may also select the same preposition and case but the meaning will\nbe different: for instance, myslet na někoho “to think of someone.”\nFinally, the preposition na itself has an adessive or allative meaning\n(see the corresponding values of the Case feature).\nThis meaning is suppressed when the preposition is selected by a predicate but\nit is more recognizable in adjuncts. In the following example, the preposition\ncombines with a noun phrase in the locative case and marks a locational modifier:\n\nKonference se koná na Slovensku . \\n Conference REFL takes-place in Slovakia .\nobl(koná, Slovensku)\nobl(takes-place, Slovakia)\ncase(Slovensku, na)\ncase(Slovakia, in)"

The assumption is that in these expressions, the flat relations\nare not syntactic head-modifier relations, and that the structural annotation is in principle arbitrary.\nThe components of a flat expression may have their own dependents, including nested flat structures.\nFor example, in the name Mary Jane Tyler Smith, both the first name (Mary Jane) and the last name\n(Tyler Smith) are flat expressions, which are combined into a larger flat name (the tree appears below).\n\nThe prototypes for flat are: (i) personal names, (ii) foreign expressions, (iii) iconic sequences, and (iv) items separated for readability.\nThese are illustrated in the sections below.\nThe application of flat may extend beyond these prototypes to, e.g., various kinds of name and number expressions.\nHowever, even if an expression is idiosyncratic or follows a specialized pattern, every effort should be made to find a head rather than employing flat.\nIf a head can be found but no substantive dependency relation is appropriate, dep can be used.\n\nNote that what is considered to be transparent linguistic syntax (as opposed to flat structure) is subject to treebank-specific policies.\n(E.g., some treebanks might provide proper grammatical analyses in the presence of code-switching,\nor treat mathematical notation as following linguistic strategies like predication.)\n\nSome languages opt to subcategorize usages of flat via subtypes.\nIn particular, many treebanks use the flat:name and flat:foreign subtypes converted from the v1 relations name and foreign.\nThe examples on this page simply use plain flat.\n\nNames\n\nA person’s name (or parts thereof) may lack the hallmarks of general constructions in the language, such that no single word can be identified as the head, in which case a flat structure applies.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\nflat(Hillary, Rodham)\nflat(Hillary, Clinton)\n\nNesting is possible:\n\nMary Jane Tyler Smith\nflat(Mary, Jane)\nflat(Tyler, Smith)\nflat(Mary, Tyler)\n\nOn occasion, an expression with no clear head at the top level will have internal syntactic modifiers or punctuation:\n\nDwayne \" The Rock \" Johnson\nflat(Dwayne, Rock)\nflat(Dwayne, Johnson)\ndet(Rock, The)\npunct(Rock, \"-2)\npunct(Rock, \"-5)\n\nThe scope of flat may extend beyond names of persons to names of other kinds of entities that depart from general headed structure.\nThe expressions under this category must be established by language-specific criteria.\n\nFlat vs. non-flat names\n\nNames that have a regular syntactic structure, like The Lord of the Rings and _Captured By\nAliens_, should be annotated with regular syntactic relations rather than flat structures:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\ndet(Lord, The)\nnmod(Lord, Rings)\ncase(Rings, of)\ndet(Rings, the)\n\nThe king of Sweden\ndet(king-2, The-1)\nnmod(king-2, Sweden-4)\ncase(Sweden-4, of-3)\n\nFor organization names with clear syntactic modification structure, the dependencies should \nalso reflect the syntactic modification structure using regular syntactic relations, as in:\n\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\namod(Resources-2, Natural-1)\ncompound(Conservation-3, Resources-2)\ncompound(Service-4, Conservation-3)\n\nIn addition, regular syntactic relations are used: (i) for a modifying determiner or similar function word and (ii) to connect \ntogether the words of a description or name which involve embedded prepositional phrases, sentences, etc.,\nwhen these relations are (i) recognized in the language being annotated (i.e., the analyses below are for\nFrench, German, and Spanish, not English) and (ii) deemed not to be grammaticalized to the extent that the original role\nof the function words has been lost.\n\nLe Japon\ndet(Japon-2, Le-1)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\ncase(Beethoven, van)\nnmod(Ludwig, Beethoven)\n\nMiguel de Cervantes y Saavedra\nconj(Cervantes, Saavedra)\ncc(Saavedra, y)\ncase(Cervantes, de)\nnmod(Miguel, Cervantes)\n\nRío de la Plata\ncase(Plata-4, de-2)\ndet(Plata-4, la-3)\nnmod(Río-1, Plata-4)\n\nA name may combine flat and non-flat structure. In a Portuguese text, the surname Paulo da Silva would be analyzed as follows:\n\nRoberto Paulo da Silva\nflat(Roberto, Paulo)\nnmod(Paulo, Silva)\ncase(Silva, da)\n\nThe above analyses of Ludwig van Beethoven and Miguel de Cervantes y Saavedra assume that van resp. de are prepositions.\nThis is true in the languages of the names' origin, but it can be expected to change when the name is used in foreign text \nor when sufficient grammaticalization has taken place. For example,\nwhen names like this are annotated in English, the appropriate analysis is as a flat name:\n\nLudwig van Beethoven was a famous German composer .\nflat(Ludwig, van)\nflat(Ludwig, Beethoven)\ndet(composer, a)\namod(composer, famous)\namod(composer, German)\ncop(composer, was)\nnsubj(composer, Ludwig)\npunct(composer, .)\n\nRío de la Plata\nflat(Río-1, de-2)\nflat(Río-1, la-3)\nflat(Río-1, Plata-4)\n\nAl Arabiya is a Saudi-owned news organization\nflat(Al-1, Arabiya-2)\nnsubj(organization-7, Al-1)\n\nAnd in Modern German or French, these prepositions have generally just become a fossilized part of a family name \nand regularly appear without the given name. Again, here, the flat analysis seems correct:\n\nVon Hohenlohe gewann das Rennen . \\n Von Hohenlohe won the race .\nflat(Von-1, Hohenlohe-2)\nnsubj(gewann-3, Von-1)\n\nForeign expressions\n\nThis encompasses expressions that may have been borrowed or quoted, but whose original grammatical structure is not necessarily accessible to speakers of the language(s) being annotated.\n\nAnd then she went : gjiko frac zen .\nparataxis(went, gjiko)\nflat(gjiko, frac)\nflat(gjiko, zen)\n\n\"Foreign\" includes not just natural languages but also notational systems that are considered external to natural language proper and are governed by separate rules (e.g., musical chord progressions, software code excerpts).\n\nThe Vienna Game move order is 1. e4 e5 2.

For example, in spite of is a fixed expression functioning as a preposition in English; bien que ('although', lit. 'well that') functions as a subordinating conjunction in French; and vare sig ('either', lit. 'be itself') functions as a (pre)conjunction in Swedish.\nThe scope of fixed MWEs corresponds roughly to the fixed expressions category of Sag et al. and should not be used for multiword expressions that are morphosyntactically flexible. \n\nCriteria\n\nFixed expressions typically do not allow intervening words, except in a few special cases such as clitics that go in a fixed position in the clause and can interrupt even fixed expressions. In addition, there may be inherently discontiguous fixed expressions, such as för … sedan in Swedish, corresponding to the English ago, which is syntactically irregular and always encloses a temporal expression, as in för 10 år sedan [“10 years ago”]. \n\nThe creation of fixed multiword expressions is the end phase of a process of grammaticalization and there are always going to be cases of multiword expressions that are only somewhat grammaticalized. For practical treebanking, it is recommended to restrict this relation to the most grammaticalized cases and to treat them as a closed class by writing language-specific documentation listing the fixed expressions of the language.\n\nStructure\n\nFixed MWEs are annotated in a flat structure, where all subsequent words in the expression \nare attached to the first one using the fixed label. The assumption is that these expressions\ndo not have any internal syntactic structure (except from a historical perspective) and that the\nstructural annotation is in principle arbitrary. In practice, however, it is highly desirable to use\na consistent annotation of all fixed MWEs in all languages.\n\nFixed MWEs should not have any internal modification.

The third requirement is often referred to as obligatory control.\nAn xcomp can also be described as a predicative complement. The subject of the xcomp is normally, but not always, controlled by the object of the next higher\nclause, if there is one, or else by the subject of the next higher\nclause.\nThese clauses tend to be non-finite in many languages,\nbut they can be finite as well. The name xcomp is\nborrowed from Lexical-Functional Grammar (see Joan Bresnan, 2001, Lexical-Functional Syntax, chapter on “Predication Relations”).\n\nWe expect them to change their minds\nxcomp(expect, change)\nobj(expect, them)\n\nSue asked George to respond to her offer\nxcomp(asked, respond)\niobj(asked, George)\n\nI started to work there yesterday\nxcomp(started, work)\n\nYou look great\nxcomp(look, great)\n\nI consider him a fool\nobj(consider, him)\nxcomp(consider, fool)\n\nLouise struck me as a fool\nobj(struck, me)\ncase(fool, as)\nxcomp(struck, fool)\n\nI consider her honest\nobj(consider, her)\nxcomp(consider, honest)\n\nI regard her as honest\nobj(regard, her)\nmark(honest, as)\nxcomp(regard, honest)\n\nWe got COVID-19 under control\nobj(got, COVID-19)\ncase(control, under)\nxcomp(got, control)\n\nSusan is liable to be arrested\ncop(liable, is)\nxcomp(liable, arrested)\n\nThe predicative complement can be headed by various parts of speech, including a VERB, ADJ, or NOUN. A nominal predicative complement can be marked by a preposition (in English, often but not always by as). The xcomp-taking predicate of the higher clause can be a VERB or ADJ.\n\nContrast xcomp with other complement clauses where there is an overt subject or no obligatory control, which use ccomp:\n\nHe says that you like to swim\nccomp(says, like)\n\nI suggest eating now before the food gets cold\nccomp(suggest, eating)\n\nThe Inherited Subject Criterion\n\nIn examples like “I consider her honest”, the UD analysis corresponds to traditional grammar and what was termed \"raising to object\" in early generative grammar: the nominal \"her\" in these constructions is treated as the object of the higher clause (as its accusative morphology and ability to passivize suggests).\n\nNote that the above condition “without its own subject” does not mean that a\nclause is an xcomp just because its subject is not overt. The subject must be necessarily inherited from a fixed position in the higher clause. That is, there should be no available interpretation where the subject of the lower clause may be distinct\nfrom the specified role of the upper clause. In cases where the missing subject may or must be distinct from a fixed role in the higher clause, ccomp should be used instead, as below.  This includes cases of arbitrary subjects and anaphoric control. In the following example, the subject of start or starting does not have to be the boss, it is any contextually relevant person or group of people. In addition, in these cases, the complement clause can often be replaced by a pronoun like it or that and it can sometimes be passivized (Starting the project was recommended by the boss).\n\nThe boss said to start the project\nccomp(said, start)\n\nThe boss recommended starting the project\nccomp(recommended, starting)\n\nPro-drop languages have clauses where the subject is not present as a separate word,\nyet it is inherently present (and often deducible from the form of the verb).\nThe relation between clauses with pro-drop may or may not be xcomp.\nThe implicit subjects of a subordinate clause and a higher clause may be coincidentally coreferent, warranting ccomp or advcl:\n\nPíšu , protože jsem to slíbil . \\n I-write , because I-have it promised .\nadvcl(Píšu, slíbil)\nadvcl(I-write, promised)\naux(slíbil, jsem)\naux(promised, I-have)\nobj(slíbil, to)\nobj(promised, it)\nmark(slíbil, protože)\nmark(promised, because)\n\nSlíbil jsem , že budu psát . \\n Promised I-have , that I-will write .\nccomp(Slíbil, psát)\nccomp(Promised, write)\naux(Slíbil, jsem)\naux(Promised, I-have)\naux(psát, budu)\naux(write, I-will)\nmark(psát, že)\nmark(write, that)\n\nIt is only xcomp if the implicit subject depends on an argument from a higher clause (one cannot be varied without the other):\n\nSlíbil jsem psát . \\n Promised I-have to-write .\nxcomp(Slíbil, psát)\nxcomp(Promised, to-write)\naux(Slíbil, jsem)\naux(Promised, I-have)\n\nSecondary Predicates\n\nThe following is excerpted from a more detailed discussion of secondary predicates.\n\nThe xcomp relation is also used in constructions that are known as secondary predicates or predicatives.\nExamples:\n\n* She declared the cake beautiful.\n* She declared the cake a success.\n\nWe could paraphrase the sentence using a subordinate clause: She declared that the cake was beautiful.\nThere are two predicates mixed in one clause: 1. she declared something, and 2. the cake was beautiful (according to her opinion).\nThe secondary predicate will be attached to the main predicate as an xcomp:\n\nShe declared the cake beautiful .\nnsubj(declared, She)\nobj(declared, cake)\nxcomp(declared, beautiful)\n\nThe subject of \"declared\" is again obligatorily controlled by a role in the higher clause. In the enhanced representation, there is an additional subject link showing the secondary predication:\n\nShe declared the cake beautiful .\nnsubj(declared, She)\nobj(declared, cake)\nxcomp(declared, beautiful)\nnsubj(beautiful, cake)\n\nA Czech example:\n\njmenovat někoho generálem \\n to-appoint someone as-a-general\nobj(jmenovat, někoho)\nxcomp(jmenovat, generálem)\n\nRemember that xcomp is used for core arguments of predicates\nso it will not be used for non-core instances of secondary predication.\nFor instance, in She entered the room sad we also have a double predication\n(she entered the room; she was sad).\nBut sad is not a core argument of enter: leaving it out will neither affect grammaticality\nnor significantly alter the meaning of the verb.\nOn the other hand, leaving out beautiful in she declared the cake beautiful\nwill either render the sentence ungrammatical or lead to a different interpretation of declared.\n\nThe result is that in She entered the room sad, sad is considered a modifier (not complement) of the verb,\nwith the relation advcl instead of xcomp.\n(This was changed from the previous approach which analyzed the secondary predication directly with acl,\nbecause the nominal predicand is not always overt, and even when it is, the adjective does not really belong to the same nominal phrase.)\n\nShe entered the room sad .\nnsubj(entered, She)\ndet(room, the)\nobj(entered, room)\nadvcl(entered, sad)\npunct(entered, .)\n\nEntering the room sad is not recommended .\ncsubj(recommended, Entering)\ndet(room, the)\nobj(Entering, room)\nadvcl(Entering, sad)\ncop(recommended, is)\nadvmod(recommended, not)\npunct(recommended, .)\n\nNotice that while can be inserted before sad, clearly marking it as a clause.\n\nA Czech example:\n\nVstoupila do místnosti smutná . \\n She-entered to room sad .\nadvcl(Vstoupila, smutná)\nadvcl(She-entered, sad)\n\nThere is no need to decide whether an example like the following is a depictive or a manner adverbial:\n\nLinda found the money walking our dog .\nnsubj(found, Linda)\ndet(money, the)\nobj(found, money)\nadvcl(found, walking)\ndet(dog, our)\nobj(walking, dog)\npunct(found, .)\n\nThe optional secondary predication or controlled adjunct subject relation can be represented with an enhanced dependency edge\nin addition to the advcl relation.\n\nSome other cases that could be regarded as secondary predicates are just treated as obliques. In particular, locative arguments of verbs are always treated as obliques:\n\nShe put a book on the table .\nnsubj(put, She)\ndet(book, a)\nobj(put, book)\ncase(table, on)\ndet(table, the)\nobl(put, table)\npunct(put, .)"

    "shortdef": "dislocated elements",
    "content": "The dislocated relation is used for fronted or postposed elements\nthat do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a\nsentence. These elements often appear to be in the periphery of the sentence, and may be separated off with a comma intonation.\n\nIt is used for fronted elements that introduce the topic of a sentence, as in the following Japanese and Greek examples. The dislocated element attaches to the head of the clause to which it belongs:\n\n象 は 鼻 が 長い \\n zoo wa hana ga naga-i \\n elephant TOPIC nose SUBJ long-PRES\ndislocated(長い-5, 象-1)\n\nto jani ton kserume poli kala \\n the John-Acc him know-1pl very well \ndislocated(kserume, jani)\n\nHowever, it would not be used for a topic-marked noun that is also the subject of the sentence; this would be an nsubj.\n\nIt is also used for postposed elements. The dislocated elements attach to the same governor as the dependent that they double for. Right dislocated elements are frequent in spoken languages. French and Greek examples follow.\n\nIl faut pas la manger , la plasticine \\n It must not it eat , the playdough\nobj(manger, la-4)\ndislocated(manger, plasticine)\nobj(eat, it-13)\ndislocated(eat, playdough)\n\nton kserume oli mas edho poli kala, to jani \ndislocated(kserume, jani)"
