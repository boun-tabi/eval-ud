  "ADP": {
    "shortdef": "adposition",
    "content": "Definition\n\nAdposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions.\nAdpositions belong to a closed set of items that occur before\n(preposition) or after (postposition) a complement composed of a noun\nphrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and\nthat form a single structure with the complement to express its\ngrammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.\n\nIn many languages, adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword\nexpressions, such as in spite of, because of, thanks to. The\ncomponent words are then still tagged according to their basic use\n(in is ADP, spite is NOUN, etc.) and their status as\nmultiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.\n\nNote that in Germanic languages, some prepositions may also function\nas verbal particles, as in give in or hold on. They\nare still tagged ADP and not PART.\n\nA common pathway of grammaticalization is from verbs to adpositions.\nAlong this pathway of grammaticalization, it is common to have words\nwith roughly their original verbal meaning and belonging to the inflectional\nparadigm of an extant verb with suitable verbal morphology but functioning\nin a sentence as a preposition, with certain syntactic tests or finer-grained\nsemantic criteria suggesting that they are prepositions (for example, they have no\nunderstood subject). These words have\nvariously been called deverbal prepositions, deverbal connectives, \nquasi-prepositions, or pseudo-prepositions. In English this includes words like\nfollowing, concerning, regarding, and given. \nSimilar cases occur in many other languages (such as French concernant and suivant).\nFor UD, we have decided that such words\nwill be given the POS VERB and normal verbal morphological features,\nbut they can be recognized as syntactically adpositions by giving them the grammatical relation\ncase or mark. Conversely, in cases where there is no longer an extant verb or any still existent \nverb has a quite different meaning, grammaticalization is viewed as complete and the POS should be ADP. \nIn English this would apply to pending or during (from the disused verb dure:\n“The wood being preserv’d dry will dure a very long time” – Evelyn 1664).\n\nExamples\n\n- in\n- to\n- during\n\nReferences\n\n- Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

    "content": "Definition\n\nAn auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a\nverb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the\nlexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality.\nIt is often a verb (which may have non-auxiliary uses as well) but many languages\nhave nonverbal TAMVE markers and these should also be tagged AUX. The class AUX\nalso include copulas (in the narrow sense of pure linking words for nonverbal predication).\n\nLess commonly, an auxiliary may just cross-reference person and number of a core argument,\nwithout also expressing any TAMVE (tense, aspect, mood, voice, evidentiality) feature.\nThis only applies if the auxiliary is spelled as a separate word; if it is written together\nwith the verbal stem, annotate the cross-reference (agreement) features on the verb and\ndo not attempt to cut the agreement morpheme as a separate syntactic word. Even if written\nseparately, the default approach is to treat such words as personal pronouns (PRON).\nBut if there are strong arguments against a pronoun analysis, it is possible to use AUX\ninstead. Issue #782 discusses\nexamples from K'iche' [quc].\n\nModal verbs may count as auxiliaries in some languages (English). In\nother languages their behavior is not too different from the [main\nverbs](VERB) and they are thus tagged VERB.\n\nNote that not all languages have grammaticalized auxiliaries, and\neven where they exist the dividing line between full verbs and\nauxiliaries can be expected to vary between languages. Exactly\nwhich words are counted as AUX should be part of the\nlanguage-specific documentation.\n\nExamples\n\n- Tense auxiliaries: has (done), is (doing), will (do)\n- Passive auxiliaries: was (done), got (done)\n- Modal auxiliaries: should (do), must (do)\n- Verbal copulas: He is a teacher.\n- Agreement auxiliaries: [quc] la (2nd person singular formal), alaq (2nd person plural formal)\n\nReferences\n\n- Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

However,\ncardinal numerals in the narrow sense (one, five, hundred) are not\ntagged DET even though some authors would include them in\nquantifiers.

Similar behavior means:\n  * They are more likely to be used attributively (modifying a noun phrase) than substantively (replacing a noun phrase). They may occur alone, though.\n    If they do, it is either because of ellipsis, or because the hypothetical modified noun is something unspecified and general, as in All [visitors] must pay.\n  * Their inflection (if applicable) is similar to that of adjectives, and distinct from nouns.\n    They agree with the nouns they modify.\n    Especially the ability to inflect for gender is typical for adjectives and determiners.\n    (Gender of nouns is determined lexically and determiners may be required by the grammar to agree with their nouns in gender; therefore they need to inflect for gender.)\n* Possessives vary across languages.
