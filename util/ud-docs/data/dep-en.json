    "content": "UNDER REVISION \n\nThis document presents detailed guidelines for relative clauses and clefts in English. It is a product of extensive deliberations among the UD Core Group, but is meant to apply to other languages only to the extent that constructions pattern similarly to English. Crosslinguistically, there is considerable variation in relative constructions and related phenomena; work on a separate typologically-oriented document is underway.\n\nA relative clause (RC) is a clause modifying some head (typically a noun) that is understood to fulfill some grammatical role in the RC. \nThe head is said to be \"extracted\" from the RC.\n\nMost RCs are adnominal, hence the relation acl:relcl. Adverbial RCs attach as advcl:relcl, as discussed below.\n\nRCs are usually finite (people who live in glass houses), but may also be infinitival (I found a house in which to live, I found a house (for my mother) to live in). Gerund-participial and past-participial clauses (people living in glass houses, students given high marks) are never considered relative clauses in the approach described here.\n\nIn the Basic Dependencies representation, the main predicate of the RC attaches to the head as acl:relcl. This is shown in the example on the left.\n\nIn the Enhanced Dependencies layer, there is an additional dependency in the opposite direction to indicate the role from which the head was \"extracted\".

UD adopts the traditional analysis of that as a relative pronoun roughly interchangeable with which etc.\n\nIn the Enhanced Dependencies layer (right), the relativizer instead attaches to its antecedent via the ref relation (as the antecedent is directly connected to a role in the RC).\n\n<table id=\"rc-example3\"> \n<tbody><tr><td width=\"550\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 7 5 obj color:orange\n1 I          0   _\n2 saw        0   _\n3 the        0   _\n4 book       2 obj  \n5 which  which PRON WDT PronType=Rel 7 obj    \n6 you        7 nsubj    \n7 bought     4 acl:relcl  \n8 .          0   _\n</div>\n</td><td width=\"650\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 4 5 ref color:blue\nvisual-style 7 4 obj color:blue\n1 I          0   _\n2 saw        0   _\n3 the        0   _\n4 book       2 obj 7:obj _\n5 which  which PRON WDT PronType=Rel 4 ref    \n6 you        7 nsubj    \n7 bought     4 acl:relcl  \n8 .          0   _\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n\n<table> \n<tbody><tr><td width=\"550\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 5 3 advmod color:orange\n1 the the DET DT Definite=Def|PronType=Art 2 det  \n2 episode episode NOUN NN Number=Sing 0 root  \n3 where where ADV WRB PronType=Rel 5 advmod  \n4 Monica Monica PROPN NNP Number=Sing 5 nsubj  \n5 sings sing VERB VBZ Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin 2 acl:relcl  \n</div>\n</td><td width=\"650\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 2 3 ref color:blue\nvisual-style 5 2 obl color:blue\n1 the the DET DT Definite=Def|PronType=Art 2 det  \n2 episode episode NOUN NN Number=Sing 0 root 5:obl _\n3 where where ADV WRB PronType=Rel 2 ref  \n4 Monica Monica PROPN NNP Number=Sing 5 nsubj  \n5 sings sing VERB VBZ Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin 2 acl:relcl  \n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n\n<table> \n<tbody><tr><td width=\"550\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 4 3 nmod:poss color:orange\n1 the the DET DT Definite=Def|PronType=Art 2 det  \n2 woman woman NOUN NN Number=Sing 0 root  \n3 whose whose PRON WP$ Poss=Yes|PronType=Rel 4 nmod:poss  \n4 cat cat NOUN NN Number=Sing 5 nsubj  \n5 smells smell VERB VBZ Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin 2 acl:relcl  \n</div>\n</td><td width=\"650\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 2 3 ref color:blue\nvisual-style 4 2 nmod:poss color:blue\n1 the the DET DT Definite=Def|PronType=Art 2 det  \n2 woman woman NOUN NN Number=Sing 0 root 4:nmod:poss _\n3 whose whose PRON WP$ Poss=Yes|PronType=Rel 2 ref  \n4 cat cat NOUN NN Number=Sing 5 nsubj  \n5 smells smell VERB VBZ Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin 2 acl:relcl  \n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n\n<table> \n<tbody><tr><td width=\"550\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 5 3 xcomp color:orange\nvisual-style 6 3 mark color:orange\nvisual-style 7 3 cop color:orange\n1 the the DET DT Definite=Def|PronType=Art 2 det  \n2 country country NOUN NN Number=Sing 0 root  \n3 that that PRON WP PronType=Rel 5 xcomp  \n4 we we PRON PRP Case=Nom|Number=Plur|Person=1|PronType=Pers 5 nsubj  \n5 want want VERB VBP Mood=Ind|Number=Plur|Person=1|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin 2 acl:relcl  \n6 to to PART TO  3 mark  _\n7 be be VERB VB VerbForm=Inf 3 cop  \n </div>\n</td><td width=\"650\">\n<div class=\"conllu-parse\">\nvisual-style 2 3 ref color:blue\nvisual-style 2 6 mark color:blue\nvisual-style 2 7 cop color:blue\nvisual-style 5 2 xcomp color:blue\n1 the the DET DT Definite=Def|PronType=Art 2 det  \n2 country country NOUN NN Number=Sing 0 root 5:xcomp _\n3 that that PRON WP PronType=Rel 2 ref  \n4 we we PRON PRP Case=Nom|Number=Plur|Person=1|PronType=Pers 5 nsubj  \n5 want want VERB VBP Mood=Ind|Number=Plur|Person=1|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin 2 acl:relcl  \n6 to to PART TO  2 mark  _\n7 be be VERB VB VerbForm=Inf 2 cop  \n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n\nA relative clause with no relativizer, like (1), is called a reduced relative clause. One with a relativizer, like (3), is called a nonreduced relative clause.\n\nBasic UD is shown for the rest of the examples below.\n\nNotable Properties\n\nRelativization can create unbounded dependency—an element can be extracted from several levels of embedding:\n\nI saw the book which you pretended to think was boring\nacl:relcl(book, pretended)\nnsubj(boring, which)\nxcomp(pretended, think)\nccomp(think, boring)\n\nSemantically, relative clauses may be specifying/restrictive (helping to narrow a set of referents), or ascriptive/nonrestrictive (adding detail about a referent that has already been identified):\n\n- Specifying\n   I rented the movie which you bought* (as opposed to some other one).\n- Ascriptive\n   I introduced myself to John, who promptly forgot my name*.\n   I rented the movie, which you bought* (as opposed to renting).\n   I tried to explain myself – which was a bad idea*. [antecedent is a clause]\n\nThe specifying/ascriptive distinction does not affect the UD analysis.\n\nAdverbial Relative Clauses\n\nOn occasion, a relative clause attaches not as a noun modifier but as a clause modifier, and therefore the appropriate relation is advcl:relcl.\nOne such case is clausal anaphora, where the antecedent is a clause:\n\nI tried to explain myself – which was a bad idea\nadvcl:relcl(tried, idea)\nnsubj(idea, which)\n\nThis relation can also be seen in free relatives and it-clefts.\n\nPredicate Ellipsis in the Relative Clause\n\nA pronominal relativizer may stand for a predicate in a relative clause:\n\nIf we lose ( which/PRON we probably will ) , I'm blaming you.\nadvcl(blaming, lose)\nadvcl:relcl(lose, which)\nnsubj(which, we-6)\nadvmod(which, probably)\naux(which, will)\n\nPreposition Stranding\n\nA preposition may be left \"stranded\" in the relative clause (its object corresponding to the head of the RC):\n\n- The house (that) you said you wanted to live in is for sale.\n  * Non-RC paraphrase: The house is on sale; you said you wanted to live in that house.\n\nThe Basic UD analysis depends on whether it is a reduced or nonreduced RC. \nIn a nonreduced RC, the relativizer is available to fill a role in the RC, and thus gets marked with \nthe preposition (even if this contributes to the nonprojectivity of the tree):\n\nthe house that you said you wanted to live in\nacl:relcl(house, said)\nccomp(said, wanted)\nxcomp(wanted, live)\nobl(live, that)\ncase(that, in)\n\nIn a reduced RC, however, there is no nominal to fill the role in the RC, \nso the preposition gets promoted to the head of the phrase (similar to the treatment of Ellipsis). \nIf the stranded preposition belongs to a copular predicate, it assumes the role of that predicate:\n\nthe house you said you wanted to live in\nacl:relcl(house, said)\nccomp(said, wanted)\nxcomp(wanted, live)\nobl(live, in)\n\nthe problem the question is about\nacl:relcl(problem, about)\nnsubj(about, question)\ncop(about, is)\n\nThe same treatment applies to a preposition stranded in a free relative.\n\nIn the Enhanced Dependencies representation, the stranded preposition attaches to the relativized element \nunless the preposition has been promoted to function as the predicate.\n\nPrepositional Relatives\n\nAs an alternative to stranding, the preposition may occur before the relativizer (for some relativizers, particularly which, whom, and whose):\n\nthe house in which you live\nacl:relcl(house, live)\nobl(live, which)\ncase(which, in)\n\nthe crown from where the jewels were stolen\nacl:relcl(crown, stolen)\nobl(stolen, where)\ncase(where, from)\n\nthe king from whom the jewels were stolen\nacl:relcl(king, stolen)\nobl(stolen, whom)\ncase(whom, from)\n\nthe king from whose crown we stole the jewels\nacl:relcl(king, stole)\nobl(stole, crown)\ncase(crown, from)\nnmod:poss(crown, whose)\n\nthe king bequeathed a crown , the jewels of which were stolen\nacl:relcl(crown, stolen)\nnmod(jewels, which)\ncase(which, of)\nnsubj:pass(stolen, jewels)\n\nInfinitival Relatives\n\nRelative clauses may be infinitival, in which case they do not generally have a relativizer.\n\n~~~sdparse\nI found a bagel to eat\nacl:relcl(bagel, eat)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nI have a suggestion to make\nacl:relcl(suggestion, make)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nI found someone to work on Saturdays\nacl:relcl(someone, work)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nI found a house (for my mother) to live in\nacl:relcl(house, live)\nobl(live, in)\n~~~\n\nInfinitival prepositional relatives with a relativizer are possible as an alternative to stranding:\n\n~~~sdparse\nI found a house in which to live\nacl:relcl(house, live)\nobl(live, which)\ncase(which, in)\n~~~\n\nNote that an adnominal infinitival clause is only a relative clause if the head noun is understood to double as a dependent of the subordinate clause. \nIn the above examples, the bagel is the thing eaten (which corresponds to an obj in enhanced dependencies); someone is the person assigned to work (the enhanced nsubj); and so on.\n\nBy contrast, the following are plain acl because suggestion and ability are not understood as playing any role in the infinitival clause:\n\n~~~sdparse\nyour suggestion to eat early\nacl(suggestion, eat)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nyour ability to navigate in the dark\nacl(ability, navigate)\n~~~\n\nSome infinitivals are ambiguous between two plausible readings. A proposal to speed up the meeting can be construed as a proposal of speeding up the meeting, i.e. speeding up is the content of the proposal (acl); or the proposal can be understood to consist of some method of saving time, in which case the proposal is construed as speeding up the meeting—a subject relative interpretation (acl:relcl).\n\nWith nouns like proposal, the of-paraphrase test can be used as a diagnostic for the non-relative interpretation.\nAnother diagnostic is substituting something, somewhere, some way(?), or similar, which favors the relative clause interpretation:[^3]\n\nTODO: Currently acl has \"a simple way to get my discount\". Is this an adjunct relative or a complement of \"way\"? It can be paraphrased as \"way of getting my discount\". Similarly: \"reason to leave\"/\"reason for leaving\".\n\n~~~sdparse\nsomething to speed up the meeting\nacl:relcl(something, speed)\n~~~ \n\n[^3]: However, this test fails for a suggestion to make: \\something to make is not a valid substitution because make a suggestion* is a light verb construction.\n\nRCs versus Non-relative Modifier Clauses\n\nWhen, where, why, and how frequently introduce adverbial clauses (advcl). They can also introduce non-relative adnominal modifier clauses (acl) similarly providing time/place/manner information:\n\n~~~sdparse\nWhen you leave , be sure to let me know .\nadvmod(leave, When)\nadvcl(sure, leave)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nThe headlines when Nixon resigned were legendary .\nadvmod(resigned, when)\nacl(headlines, resigned)\n~~~\n\nHowever, it should be considered a relative construction if the WH-adverb can be paraphrased by in which or similar, or if the head noun reifies the kind of relation (the time when, the place where, the reason why).\n\n~~~sdparse\nthe time when the pizza exploded\nacl:relcl(time, exploded)\nadvmod(exploded, when)\n~~~\n\nSome phrases are ambiguous. The ceremony where we became citizens can be interpreted as an RC if the bestowal of citizenship happened during the ceremony (in which interpretation,^2] thus acl:relcl). In that interpretation, the ceremony serves as the setting for the bestowal of citizenship. But there is another interpretation, in which the ceremony need not be a naturalization ceremony: if where we became citizens helps identify the place of a separate ceremony, we treat this as a [free relative attaching to the nominal as advmod, akin to here. Finally, for the ceremony when we became citizens, we take when we became citizens to be locating the ceremony in time, designated with acl (but other readings might be possible). Fronting the WH-clause in a matrix clause may help distinguish the readings: Where/when we became citizens, there was a nice ceremony suggests the WH-clause is providing the place or time setting for the ceremony, not the reverse.\n\n[^2]: Or, formally, wherein.\n\nTesting whether WH-adverb is a Relativizer\n\nGiven that modifier clauses marked with when or where can be hard to classify as relative or non-relative,[^5] we use the following heuristics:\n\n[^5]: CGEL presents arguments that two structures are possible in some cases (pp. 1078-1079).\n\n1. A where-clause that modifies a reference to (broadly speaking) a place/situation/arrangement, or a when-clause that modifies a reference to a time, is a relative clause.\n\n   * the hole where the ground caved in\n   * I heard it on [a show where members of the administration often appear as guests]\n   * I heard it on [one of the Sunday shows, where it is customary to have interviews with administration spokespeople]\n   * the date when I’ll be back from my trip\n   * please schedule it on [the 26th, when I’ll be back from my trip]\n  \n   An adnominal where-clause that can be readily paraphrased with in which or similar is also considered a relative clause:\n   * a situation where/in which nobody wins\n   * a journey where/on which you get to experience different cultures\n\n2. If it is a where-clause and where has a locative meaning, treat it as a free relative.\n\n   * Where I had lunch yesterday, it was very windy.\n   * Where I was \\\\ yesterday, it was very windy.\n   * Where I came from \\\\, it was very windy.\n\n3. Otherwise, default to the non-relative analysis (acl or advcl). Here the adverb is functioning as neither interrogative nor relative.\n\n   * Where you might be tempted to fold, I am willing to call the bet. (non-locative)\n   * When Nixon resigned, the disruption was substantial.\n   * Nobody had anticipated [the disruption when Nixon resigned]\n   * the unemployment rate when Biden came into office\n\nFree Relatives\n\nFree relatives are noun phrases containing a relative clause modifying a WH-phrase. \nThere is no separate relativizer in the RC; it is \"fused\" with the head (thus these constructions are also known as fused relatives).\n\n~~~sdparse\nI 'll have whatever/PRON she 's having .\nobj(have, whatever)\nacl:relcl(whatever, having)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nYou can go where/ADV you want and eat what you want .\nadvmod(go, where)\nadvcl:relcl(where, want-6)\nobj(eat, what)\nacl:relcl(what, want-11)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nWhat/DET money we have left will go to charity\ndet(money, What)\nacl:relcl(money, have)\nnsubj(go, money)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nI don't like how/ADV it looks (CGEL p. 1077)\nobj(like, how)\nadvcl:relcl(how, looks)\n~~~\n\nWe adopt a simple rule that advcl:relcl (rather than acl:relcl) applies to all free relatives headed by a WH-adverb (where, when, why, or how). \n\nFree Relatives versus Interrogative/Exclamative Complement Clauses\n\nFree relatives are subtly different from interrogative clauses, where the WH-word making it interrogative is inside the clause.\nVerbs such as wonder, know, and tell license interrogative complement clauses (including ones beginning with whether).\nWith verbs like know and tell that license either a complement clauses or a direct object, disambiguating between the two types of WH-complements can be difficult.\n\nAccording to CGEL (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, pp. 1070–1079), in contrast to interrogative clauses, free relatives \n- are always finite;\n- are never marked by whether; \n- generally permit WH-ever heads (Eat what(ever) you want); \n- cannot be reduced with a non-ever head, even given sufficient context\n   Free relative: He bought what I was selling → \\I was selling something (he bought what!).\n   cf. interrogative: He wondered what I was selling → I was selling something (he wondered what!).*;\n- never license else after a non-ever head (\\He bought what else I was selling) [this test is from SIEG*, Huddleston et al. 2021, p. 291].\n\nAn example where they correspond to clearly distinct readings is I asked what he asked:\n- Free relative reading: 'I asked that thing that he asked (the same question that he asked)'\n- Interrogative reading: 'I asked about the content of his question (I know he asked something but I don't know what)'\n\nA subtler case is Alice doesn't know what Kim said (the interrogative reading, 'Alice doesn't know what the content of Kim's statement was', is more likely, but the free relative reading 'Alice isn't familiar with the set of facts that Kim shared' is also possible). In general, with predicates of cognition and communication that permit clausal complements, we take the interrogative interpretation to be the default reading if both readings are plausible.\n\nThe following contain interrogative complement clauses, not free relatives, and thus use ccomp:\n\n~~~sdparse\nI need to know who you are planning to leave with .\nobl(leave, who)\ncase(who, with)\nccomp(know, leave)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\nI don't know where he lives , who he is , how old he is , how much money he has , what car he drives , to whom he is married , whether he has kids , or why he is here .\nccomp(know, lives)\nadvmod(lives, where)\nconj(lives, who)\nnsubj(who, he-9)\ncop(who, is-10)\nconj(lives, old)\nadvmod(old, how-12)\ncop(old, is-15)\nconj(lives, has-21)\nadvmod(much, how-17)\namod(money, much)\nobj(has, money)\nconj(lives, drives)\nnsubj(drives, car)\ndet(car, what)\nconj(lives, married)\nobl(married, whom)\ncase(whom, to)\nconj(lives, has-36)\nmark(has-36, whether)\nconj(lives, here)\nadvmod(here, why)\n~~~\n\nInterrogative WH-clauses can also function as clause adjuncts:\n\nWhether you like it or not , it works .\nmark(like, Whether)\nconj(like, not)\nadvcl(works, like)\n\nWhatever it is , I 'm against it !\nadvcl(against, Whatever)\nnsubj(Whatever, it)\ncop(Whatever, is)\n\nWhatever your reasons , I disagree .\nadvcl(disagree, Whatever)\nnsubj(Whatever, reasons)\n\nSee No matter and similar below.\n\nExclamative clauses beginning with how or what may also function as complements:\n\n- I know/\\*wonder what a jerk he is!\n   ~~~sdparse\nI know what a jerk he is !\nccomp(know, jerk)\ndet:predet(jerk, what)\ndet(jerk, a)\nnsubj(jerk, he)\ncop(jerk, is)\n~~~\n- I love how well everyone behaved.\n~~~sdparse\nI love how well everyone behaved .\nccomp(love, behaved)\nadvmod(behaved, well)\nadvmod(well, how)\n~~~\n- I noticed how big a car he has. ('I noticed that he has a remarkably big car.')\n~~~sdparse\nI noticed how big a car he has .\nccomp(noticed, has)\nobj(has, car)\namod(car, big)\nadvmod(big, how)\n~~~\n\n☞ TODO: With the exclamative clause analysis these results with BE as the RC predicate should be revisited.\n\n☞ TODO: plain acl for a WH-clause: is this limited to interrogative and exclamative complements of nouns, and non-RC adjuncts (\"press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad\")? <http://match.grew.fr/?corpus=UD_English-EWT@dev&custom=61c1f3622bda6>\n\nCyclic cases\n\nIn some cases, promotion is required to avoid a cycle. For example, in the sentence I want to sample whatever dish this is, whatever dish this is is a free relative with a copular embedded clause. The word dish cannot simultaneously be treated as the copular predicate and the head of the free relative (because it cannot be an acl:relcl dependent on itself), so the auxiliary is promoted to the head of the embedded clause and assigned the acl:relcl relation.\n\n~~~sdparse\nI want to sample whatever dish this is .\nobj(sample, dish)\ndet(dish, whatever)\nacl:relcl(dish, is)\nnsubj(is, this)\n~~~\n\nClefts\n\nCleft constructions pertain to the information packaging of a clause. \nThey have the function of foregrounding some material relative to the rest of the clause.\n\nPseudoclefts\n\nA free relative can be used within a copular construction to background some material relative to a foregrounded element. \nJohn is foregrounded in the following two variants of the pseudocleft construction:\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- John is who we want to help .\nroot(-ROOT-, who)\nnsubj(who, John)\nacl:relcl(who, want)\ncop(who, is)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- Who we want to help is John .\nroot(-ROOT-, John)\nnsubj(John, Who)\nacl:relcl(Who, want)\ncop(John, is)\n~~~\n\nThe following show the pseudocleft construction being used to foreground a clause:\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- What John did was to play tennis .\nmark(play, to)\ncop(play, was)\nnsubj:outer(play, What)\nacl:relcl(What, did)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- What the committee asked is whether the plan worked .\nnsubj:outer(worked, What)\nacl:relcl(What, asked)\ncop(worked, is)\nmark(worked, whether)\nnsubj(worked, plan)\nroot(-ROOT-, worked)\n~~~\n\nIt-clefts\n\nThe it-cleft construction serves a similar purpose—foregrounding one element (with expletive it plus copula). \nThe remainder of the sentence is a standard (not free[^4]) relative clause that elaborates on the copular predication. \nCGEL (p. 416) describes it as a relative clause functioning as a dependent of the main clause (versus the canonical function of a relative clause as dependent within a nominal phrase). \nIn UD terms, the relative clause is adverbial; we therefore use advcl:relcl:\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- It 's John who we want to help .\nexpl(John, It)\ncop(John, 's)\nroot(-ROOT-, John)\nadvcl:relcl(John, want)\nxcomp(want, help)\nobj(help, who)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- It was with John that/PRON I went to the movies .\nexpl(John, It)\ncop(John, was)\nroot(-ROOT-, John)\ncase(John, with)\nadvcl:relcl(John, went)\nobl(went, that)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- Was it really that/SCONJ it was raining that/PRON bothered you ?\nroot(-ROOT-, raining)\nexpl(raining, it-3)\ncop(raining, Was)\nadvmod(raining, really)\nmark(raining, that-5)\nexpl(raining, it-6)\naux(raining, was)\nadvcl:relcl(raining, bothered)\nnsubj(bothered, that-9)\nobj(bothered, you)\n~~~\n\n~~~sdparse\n-ROOT- It 's that/SCONJ he 's so self-satisfied that/PRON I find offputting . (CGEL p. 1418)\nroot(-ROOT-, self-satisfied)\nexpl(self-satisfied, It)\nmark(self-satisfied, that-4)\nnsubj(self-satisfied, he)\ncop(self-satisfied, 's-6)\ncop(self-satisfied, 's-3)\nadvcl:relcl(self-satisfied, find)\nobj(find, that-9)\nxcomp(find, offputting)\n~~~\n\nNote that relativizer that receives the PRON tag, but its antecedent may be a wide variety of constituent types.\nIn (50), we are forced to use obl for the attachment of the relativizer even though it is not marked by a preposition.\n\nThe it is nonreferential, so we use expl (though the applicability of the term \"expletive\" here is controversial).\n\n[^4]: Previous versions of the it-cleft guidelines specified that for It's John who we want to help, the phrase who we want to help should be treated as a free relative. But note that the sentence can be paraphrased as It's John that we want to help or even It's John we want to help, whereas free relatives require a WH-word to serve as the head.\n\nIt-clefts versus Extraposition\n\nIt-clefts may resemble extraposition. It is clear that we should decline is an example of extraposition, discussed at expl: the heavy clausal subject that we should decline is postponed to the end of the sentence, with expletive it as placeholder in the usual subject position. By contrast, the it-clefts described above involve a relative clause (which may start with relativizer that, or another relativizer like who or which, or no relativizer at all).\n\nAccording to Calude (2008, pp. 20-21), the key test is that, for extraposition, it can be replaced by the delayed clause. \nFor it-clefts, this yields an ungrammatical result:\n\n- EXTRAPOSITION: It is clear that we should decline → That we should decline is clear\n- IT-CLEFT: It is John that we want to help → *That we want to help is John\n  * Additionally, the acceptability in this context of replacing that with who(m) shows that it is a relativizer, not a complementizer.\n- IT-CLEFT: It was with John that I went to the movies → *That I went to the movies was with John\n- IT-CLEFT: Was it really that it was raining that bothered you? → *Was that bothered you really that it was raining?\n- EXTRAPOSITION: Did it bother you that it was raining? → Did that it was raining bother you?\n~~~sdparse\nDid it bother you that it was raining ?\naux(bother, Did)\nexpl(bother, it-2)\nobj(bother, you)\ncsubj(bother, raining)\nmark(raining, that)\nexpl(raining, it-6)\naux(raining, was)\n~~~\n- IT-CLEFT: It is that he's so self-satisfied that I find offputting → *That I find offputting is that he's so self-satisfied\n- EXTRAPOSITION: I find it offputting that he's so self-satisfied → I find that he's so self-satisfied offputting\n~~~sdparse\nI find it offputting that he 's so self-satisfied\nexpl(find, it)\nnsubj(find, I)\nxcomp(find, offputting)\nccomp(find, self-satisfied)\nmark(self-satisfied, that)\n~~~\n\nNo matter and similar\n\nThe phrase no matter is analyzed as taking a obj complement in, e.g., no matter the cost.

  "clf": {
    "shortdef": "classifier",
    "content": "A clf (classifier) is a word which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts.\nThe most canonical use is numeral classifiers, where the word is used with a number for counting objects.\nA classifier generally reflects some kind of\nconceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents.\nEtymologically, classifiers are normally historically nouns, and the words may still also be used as independent nouns,\nbut in their classifier use they have scant semantics left.\nIn most cases, the most appropriate UPOS to give classifiers will still be NOUN, though you may wish to give the words a feature\nindicating their special status as a classifier. (There is at present no Universal feature for classifiers, but NounType=Clf\nmight be apt.)\nThe clf function is intended for languages which have highly grammaticalized systems of classifiers.\nThe greatest density of such languages is in Asia.\nAs well as core classifiers, there are often also other words, sometimes called \"massifiers\" that are used in counting with\nsimilar behavior to classifiers. These typically include words for containers (\"cup\", \"box\") and units (\"month\", \"inch\"),\nsuch as Chinese 袋 ‘bag’ in 一袋米 [one bag rice] ‘a bag of rice’.\nIn a classifier language, it is usually most appropriate to also analyze these words as classifiers.\nMost other languages also count things with units, however, for these languages, such as English, clf is not used and rather\nstandard noun phrase relations are still used (despite there also being incipient grammaticalization in many cases, including English).\nSee the examples for English at the end.\n\nHere are some examples from Mandarin/Putonghua Chinese:\n\n* 三个学生 (三個學生) sān gè xuéshēng = “three students”, literally “three [human-classifier] student”\n* 三棵树 (三棵樹) sān kē shù = “three trees”, literally “three [tree-classifier] tree”\n* 三只鸟 (三隻鳥) sān zhī niǎo = “three birds”, literally “three [bird-classifier] bird”\n* 三条河 (三條河) sān tiáo hé = “three rivers”, literally “three [long-wavy-classifier] river”\n\nSyntactically, the classifier groups with the numeral rather than the noun and we therefore treat\nclassifiers as functional dependents of numerals (or possessives) using the new clf relation. (This\nis one of Greenberg’s universals and is true in almost all cases.\nA couple of exceptions are noted in Aikhenvald (2000: 105) Classifiers, OUP, but it is noticeable that in those languages\nthe putative head noun is in the genitive case.)\n\n<div class=\"sd-parse\">\nsān gè xuéshēng \\n three clf student\nnummod(xuéshēng, sān)\nclf(sān, gè)\n</div>\n\nSometimes a classifier is inserted between a demonstrative and a noun (instead of numeral and noun) [zh]:\n\n乘坐 這 輛 巴士 \\n Chéngzuò zhè liàng bāshì \\n Take this CLF bus\nobj(乘坐, 巴士)\ndet(巴士, 這)\nclf(這, 輛)\nobj(Chéngzuò, bāshì)\ndet(bāshì, zhè)\nclf(zhè, liàng)\nobj(Take, bus)\ndet(bus, this)\nclf(this, CLF)\n\nClassifier words also occur in various other constructions, and so it is important to distinguish the word in a particular\nlanguage from the universal classifier function proposed in UD. We go through here some further examples with Chinese classifiers.\n\nNo noun may appear with the number and classifier.\nIn this case, the classifier takes the role of the missing noun, and we promote the classifier to be the head.\nSo 我 買 兩 本 “I am buying two” is regarded as “I am buying two [books-CLF]”.\n\n我 買 兩 本 \\n I buy two CLF\nobj(買, 本)\nnummod(本, 兩)\n\nIn some languages, including Chinese, a classifier can also appear without a number, and frequently then has some sort of\ndeterminative function. We use the relation det for such uses of a classifier. For instance, in Cantonese ‘She bought a/the book’:\n\n佢 買 咗 本 書 \\n keoi maai zo bun syu \\n 3sg buy PERF CLF book\nobj(買, 書)\ndet(書, 本)\n\nFor languages without highly grammaticalized classifier systems, standard nominal modification relationships are used\neven when things are being counted in groups (with \"massifiers\"). For example, in English:\n\nthree cups of rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\ncase(oats, of)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)\n\nthree cups rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)"

    "content": "The relation obl:agent is used for agents of passive verbs.\nIn Czech, the agent is a nominal in the instrumental Case.\n\nCena byla udělena děkanem fakulty . \\n Prize was awarded by-dean of-faculty .\nobl:agent(udělena, děkanem)\nobl:agent(awarded, by-dean)\n\nTypical agents are animate but it is not a rule.\nInanimate agents may be sometimes difficult to distinguish from instruments,\nwhich are also coded by the instrumental case.\nInstruments are attached using the simple relation obl.\nConsider the following two examples, the first one is active and the second is passive.\n\nPraštil psa klackem . \\n He-hit dog with-a-stick .\nobl(Praštil, klackem)\nobl(He-hit, with-a-stick)\n\nPes byl praštěn klackem . \\n Dog was hit with-a-stick .\nobl(praštěn, klackem)\nobl(hit, with-a-stick)\n\nHowever, in passive sentences like Byl přejet autem “He was run over by a car,”\nthe car could be analyzed as an inanimate agent, but also as an instrument,\nwhich is supported by the plausibility of the active counterpart,\nPřejeli ho autem “They ran over him with a car.”"

  "obl:arg": {
    "shortdef": "oblique argument",
    "content": "The relation obl:arg is used for oblique arguments and distinguishes them from\nadjuncts, which use the plain obl relation. It is thus possible to preserve\nthe notion of object as it is defined in the traditional grammar of some\nlanguages, where it essentially follows the distinction between arguments and\nadjuncts (which is otherwise not reflected in the main UD relation types — see the\ndiscussion here).\nA Czech example:\n\nSpoléhám se na jeho instinkt . \\n I-rely REFL on his instinct .\nobl:arg(Spoléhám, instinkt)\nobl:arg(I-rely, instinct)\ncase(instinkt, na)\ncase(instinct, on)\n\nArguments are selected by the predicate. Their coding (preposition and\nmorphological case) is determined by the predicate; within the set of\narguments of this predicate, the coding maps the argument to a particular\nsemantic role.\nIn contrast, the semantics of an adjunct is relatively independent of the\npredicate, and typical adjuncts (such as specifications of time, location,\nmanner or instrument) can combine with a large number of different predicates.\n\nHence in the above example, the preposition na “on” and the accusative case of\nthe noun instinkt “instinct” are selected by the verb spoléhat “to rely”.\nOther verbs may also select the same preposition and case but the meaning will\nbe different: for instance, myslet na někoho “to think of someone.”\nFinally, the preposition na itself has an adessive or allative meaning\n(see the corresponding values of the Case feature).\nThis meaning is suppressed when the preposition is selected by a predicate but\nit is more recognizable in adjuncts. In the following example, the preposition\ncombines with a noun phrase in the locative case and marks a locational modifier:\n\nKonference se koná na Slovensku . \\n Conference REFL takes-place in Slovakia .\nobl(koná, Slovensku)\nobl(takes-place, Slovakia)\ncase(Slovensku, na)\ncase(Slovakia, in)"
