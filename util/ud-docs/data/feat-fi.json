    "content": "Number[subj]\n\nFinite verbs in many Indo-European languages agree in person and number with their subject.\nSome languages in other families are head-marking, which means that the verbal morphology can cross-reference\nmultiple core arguments, not just the subject. If the cross-reference involves the Number of the argument,\nwe have two layers of Number on the verb: Number[subj], and (for transitive verbs) Number[obj].\nWhile it would be possible to make the subject layer the default and use just Number for it,\nthe explicit labeling of both layers is probably more helpful in such languages, as it can reduce confusion.\n\nIn Basque (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypersonal_agreement\">polypersonal language</a>),\ncertain verbs overtly mark agreement with up to three arguments:\none in the absolutive case,\none in ergative and\none in dative.\nThus in dakarkiogu “we bring it to him/her”,\nakar is the stem (ekarri = “bring”),\nd stands for “it” (absolutive argument is the direct object of transitive verbs),\nki stands for the dative case,\no stands for “he” and\ngu stands for “we” (ergative argument is the subject of transitive verbs).\n\n* Number[abs] is the number of the absolutive argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called absnumber.\n* Number[erg] is the number of the ergative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called ergnumber.\n* Number[dat] is the number of the dative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called datnumber.\n\nOne may want to use just Number instead of Number[abs].\nHowever, there are two issues with that (at least in Basque).\nFirst, the absolutive argument is not always the subject. For transitive verbs, it is the object, so the parallelism with nominative-accusative languages would be weak anyway.\nSecond, and more important, some Basque finite verbs have additional morphemes of nominal inflection.\nThus their form reflects the person-number agreement with the absolutive argument (nor), and nominal inflection (case, number etc.) at the same time.\nExamples: dena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Sing),\ndituena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Plur|Number[erg]=Sing),\ndugunak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Sing|Number[erg]=Plur),\ndirenak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Plur).\nSo we reserve the Number feature for nominal inflection, and the Number[abs] feature for agreement.\n\nNote that we also define Person[abs] and Polite[abs], although there is no direct conflict for these features.\nBut it is better to have these features aligned with Person[erg], Polite[erg], Person[dat] and Polite[dat]."

Hence the feature\nis not restricted to situations where the word is used truly reflexively.\n\nFor example, reflexive clitics in European languages often have a wide array of possible\nfunctions (middle, passive, inchoative,\nimpersonal, or even as a lexical morpheme).\nBesides that, reflexives in some languages are also used for emphasis (while other languages\nhave separate emphatic pronouns), and in some languages they signal reciprocity (while other\nlanguages have separate reciprocal pronouns).\nUsing Reflex=Yes with all of them has the benefit that they can be easily identified\n(however, if it is possible for the annotators to distinguish contexts where a reflexive\npronoun is used reciprocally or emphatically, it is possible to combine Reflex=Yes with\nPronType=Rcp or PronType=Emp, instead of PronType=Prs).\n\nNote that while some languages also have reflexive verbs, these are in\nfact fused verbs with reflexive pronouns, as in Spanish despertarse\nor Russian проснуться (both meaning “to wake up”). Thus in these\ncases the fused token will be split to two syntactic words, one of\nthem being a reflexive pronoun. In languages where the reflexive pronoun\nis not split, it may be more appropriate to mark the verb as the middle Voice\nthan using Reflex=Yes with the verb."

Three to four dimensions of politeness are\ndistinguished in linguistic literature. The Polite feature currently covers\n(and mixes) two of them; a more elaborate system of feature values may be\ndevised in future versions of UD if needed. The two axes covered are:\n\n* speaker-referent axis (meant to include the addressee when he happens to be the referent)\n* speaker-addressee axis (word forms depend on who is the addressee, although the addressee is not referred to)\n\nChanging pronouns and/or person and/or number of the verb forms when respectable\npersons are addressed in Indo-European languages belongs to the speaker-referent\naxis because the honorific pronouns are used to refer to the addressee.\n\nIn Czech, formal second person has the same form for singular and plural, and\nis identical to informal second person plural. This involves both the pronoun\nand the finite verb but not a participle, which has no special formal form\n(that is, formal singular is identical to informal singular, not to informal plural).\n\nIn German, Spanish or Hindi, both number and person are changed (informal third\nperson is used as formal second person) and in addition, special pronouns are used\nthat only occur in the formal register ([de] Sie; [es] usted, ustedes;\n[hi] आप āpa).\n\nIn Japanese, verbs and other words have polite and informal forms but the polite\nforms are not referring to the addressee (they are not in second person). They\nare just used because of who the addressee is, even if the topic does not\ninvolve the addressee at all. This kind of polite language is called teineigo (丁寧語)\nand belongs to the speaker-addressee axis. Nevertheless, we currently use the\nsame values for both axes, i.e. Polite=Form can be used for teineigo too.\nThis approach may be refined in future."

    "content": "Number[obj]\n\nFinite verbs in many Indo-European languages agree in person and number with their subject.\nSome languages in other families are head-marking, which means that the verbal morphology can cross-reference\nmultiple core arguments, not just the subject. If the cross-reference involves the Number of the argument,\nwe have two layers of Number on the verb: Number[subj], and (for transitive verbs) Number[obj].\n\nIn Basque (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypersonal_agreement\">polypersonal language</a>),\ncertain verbs overtly mark agreement with up to three arguments:\none in the absolutive case,\none in ergative and\none in dative.\nThus in dakarkiogu “we bring it to him/her”,\nakar is the stem (ekarri = “bring”),\nd stands for “it” (absolutive argument is the direct object of transitive verbs),\nki stands for the dative case,\no stands for “he” and\ngu stands for “we” (ergative argument is the subject of transitive verbs).\n\n* Number[abs] is the number of the absolutive argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called absnumber.\n* Number[erg] is the number of the ergative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called ergnumber.\n* Number[dat] is the number of the dative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called datnumber.\n\nOne may want to use just Number instead of Number[abs].\nHowever, there are two issues with that (at least in Basque).\nFirst, the absolutive argument is not always the subject. For transitive verbs, it is the object, so the parallelism with nominative-accusative languages would be weak anyway.\nSecond, and more important, some Basque finite verbs have additional morphemes of nominal inflection.\nThus their form reflects the person-number agreement with the absolutive argument (nor), and nominal inflection (case, number etc.) at the same time.\nExamples: dena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Sing),\ndituena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Plur|Number[erg]=Sing),\ndugunak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Sing|Number[erg]=Plur),\ndirenak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Plur).\nSo we reserve the Number feature for nominal inflection, and the Number[abs] feature for agreement.\n\nNote that we also define Person[abs] and Polite[abs], although there is no direct conflict for these features.\nBut it is better to have these features aligned with Person[erg], Polite[erg], Person[dat] and Polite[dat]."
