  "AUX": {
    "shortdef": "auxiliary verb",
    "content": "Irish does not have auxiliary verbs per se. Therefore what could be considered \"auxiliary\" verbs in other languages (I have to go, I am going) are not labelled as AUX in the Irish data. However, the v2 guidelines posit that Copula verbs should be labelled as AUX instead of VERB. Copula usage is extremely frequent in Irish, and as all copular verbs in UD are recognised as Auxiliaries, we tag the copula as AUX.\n\nThere are two verbs to be in Irish: the substantive verb b√≠, which inflects for tense, mood and person as per all Irish verbs and the copula is,  which only has two tensed forms - present/future and past/conditional. For that reason, the Irish POS tagset differentiates the copula by using the POS tag AUX and labelling the substantive verb as VERB. In the literature on Irish syntax, there is some discussion over the Irish copula's syntactic role, whether it is a verb or a linking particle (Carnie, 1997). The role normally played is that of a linking element between a subject and a predicate.\n\nB√≠, as a verb, uses separate particles in negative and interrogative constructions with all tense and mood forms.\nHowever, as the copula does not inflect for mood, gender and number in the same way, it uses its own forms in these constructions.\n\nThe main forms are: \n* is (positive - present/ future)\n* n√≠ (negative - present/ future)\n* ba (positive - conditional/ past)\n* n√≠or (negative - conditional/ past)\n* an (interrogative/ positive - present/ future)\n* ar (interrogative/ positive - conditional/ past)\n* nach (interrogative/ negative - present/ future)\n* n√°r (interrogative/ negative - conditional/ past).\n\nOur analysis follows a copula-predicate-subject analysis as per U√≠ Dhonnchadha (2009), which applies to other constructions that we list here:¬†\n* Classificatory constructions: Is l√° deas √© \"It is a nice day\"  [lit. `is day nice it']\n* Ownership constructions: Is liomsa √© \"It is mine\"  [lit `is with-me it']\n* Fronting constructions: Is ise a chonaic s√© \"It is she whom he saw\" [lit. `Is her REL saw he']\n* Identification constructions: Is iad na buaiteoir√≠ \"They are the winners\"  [`is them the winners']\n* Idiomatic use: Is maith liom tae \"I like tea\" [`is good with-me tea']"

See PROPN for proper nouns and PRON for pronouns.\n\nCommon nouns\n\nIrish nouns are either masculine or feminine, and inflect for case and number. In Old Irish, nouns inflected for nominative, accusative and dative cases. All of these are now represented in Modern Irish by what's referred to as the `common' case. An exception to this is pronoun forms, where the subject and object forms differ: s√© \"he\"/ √© \"him\".\n\nThe genitive case and vocative case are marked by inflection. \n\nEach noun falls into one of five declensions.\n\nVerbal nouns\n\nv2 UD documentation for NOUN states that \"some verb forms such as gerunds and infinitives may share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or NOUN\".\n\nVerbal nouns are marked as NOUN in the Irish UD scheme. \nVerbal noun forms are used widely in Irish for the infinitive form, using the infinitive particle `a', (a dh√©anamh \"to do\") and progressive aspectual phrases (ag d√©anamh \"doing/ making\").\n\nExamples\n\nCommon nouns\n\n* fear \"man\"\n* hata an fhir \"the man's hat\"\n* a mh√∫inteoir \"teacher!\"\n\nVerbal nouns\n\n* ag d√©anamh iarrachta \"making an attempt\"\n* beidh orthu gn√≥ a dh√©anamh leis \"they will have to do business with him\"\n* scann√°n a dh√©anamh \"to make a movie\"\n* t√° obair le d√©anamh \"there is work to be done\""

Verbs can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.\n\nIrish is a VSO language, thus the verb comes first.\n\nIrish verbs sometimes inflect for person in the form of synthetic verbs. (e.g. ithim \"I eat\"; ithimid \"we eat\")\n\nThere are four moods: indicative, imperative, conditional and subjunctive. Tenses include present habitual, simple past, past habitual and future. \n\nThere is an autonomous verb form, which most closely correlates to the English passive. However it is not technically a passive form as the subject is \"understood\" and the nominal argument is an object (e.g. tugadh an liathr√≥id d√≥ \"the ball was given to him\" (lit. somebody gave the ball to him)). \n\nCopula vs substantive verb 'to be'\n\nThere are two translations of the English verb `to be' in Irish:\n\n* Copula `is'\n* Substantive Verb `b√≠'\n\nThese forms behave very differently syntactically. In UD v2, the copula is tagged as AUX. \n\nsubstantive b√≠ \nThe substantive verb behaves just like normal Irish verbs. It inflects for person, number and tense.\nIt can never be used for an identity construction with two noun phrases. If it is used for identity, it follows the pattern of Verb NP PP (e.g. t√° s√© ina mh√∫inteoir \"he is a teacher\" (lit. He is in his teacher))\nThe pattern followed here is: VERB SUBJ PRED\n\nThe substantive verb is also used in conjunction with a verbal noun to form  progressive aspectual phrases.\n(e.g. t√° s√© ag rith \"he is running\" (lit. he is at running)).\n\nExamples\n\n* D'imigh m√© \"I left\"\n* D'im√≠omar \"We left\"\n* Im√≠m \"I leave\"\n* Im√≠mid \"We leave\"\n* Imeoidh m√© \"I will leave\"\n* Imeoimid \"We will leave\"\n* Cuirtear an leabhar ar an mbord \"the book is put on the table\"\n\nSource: Studies in Irish Syntax.
