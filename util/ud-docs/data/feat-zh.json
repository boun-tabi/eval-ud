The feature Reflex=Yes denotes the word type, not its actual function\nin context (which can be distinguished by dependency relation types). Hence the feature\nis not restricted to situations where the word is used truly reflexively.\n\nFor example, reflexive clitics in European languages often have a wide array of possible\nfunctions (middle, passive, inchoative,\nimpersonal, or even as a lexical morpheme).\nBesides that, reflexives in some languages are also used for emphasis (while other languages\nhave separate emphatic pronouns), and in some languages they signal reciprocity (while other\nlanguages have separate reciprocal pronouns).\nUsing Reflex=Yes with all of them has the benefit that they can be easily identified\n(however, if it is possible for the annotators to distinguish contexts where a reflexive\npronoun is used reciprocally or emphatically, it is possible to combine Reflex=Yes with\nPronType=Rcp or PronType=Emp, instead of PronType=Prs).\n\nNote that while some languages also have reflexive verbs, these are in\nfact fused verbs with reflexive pronouns, as in Spanish despertarse\nor Russian проснуться (both meaning “to wake up”). Thus in these\ncases the fused token will be split to two syntactic words, one of\nthem being a reflexive pronoun. In languages where the reflexive pronoun\nis not split, it may be more appropriate to mark the verb as the middle Voice\nthan using Reflex=Yes with the verb."

Three to four dimensions of politeness are\ndistinguished in linguistic literature. The Polite feature currently covers\n(and mixes) two of them; a more elaborate system of feature values may be\ndevised in future versions of UD if needed. The two axes covered are:\n\n* speaker-referent axis (meant to include the addressee when he happens to be the referent)\n* speaker-addressee axis (word forms depend on who is the addressee, although the addressee is not referred to)\n\nChanging pronouns and/or person and/or number of the verb forms when respectable\npersons are addressed in Indo-European languages belongs to the speaker-referent\naxis because the honorific pronouns are used to refer to the addressee.\n\nIn Czech, formal second person has the same form for singular and plural, and\nis identical to informal second person plural. This involves both the pronoun\nand the finite verb but not a participle, which has no special formal form\n(that is, formal singular is identical to informal singular, not to informal plural).\n\nIn German, Spanish or Hindi, both number and person are changed (informal third\nperson is used as formal second person) and in addition, special pronouns are used\nthat only occur in the formal register ([de] Sie; [es] usted, ustedes;\n[hi] आप āpa).\n\nIn Japanese, verbs and other words have polite and informal forms but the polite\nforms are not referring to the addressee (they are not in second person). They\nare just used because of who the addressee is, even if the topic does not\ninvolve the addressee at all. This kind of polite language is called teineigo (丁寧語)\nand belongs to the speaker-addressee axis. Nevertheless, we currently use the\nsame values for both axes, i.e. Polite=Form can be used for teineigo too.\nThis approach may be refined in future."

If the cross-reference involves the Number of the argument,\nwe have two layers of Number on the verb: Number[subj], and (for transitive verbs) Number[obj].\n\nIn Basque (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypersonal_agreement\">polypersonal language</a>),\ncertain verbs overtly mark agreement with up to three arguments:\none in the absolutive case,\none in ergative and\none in dative.\nThus in dakarkiogu “we bring it to him/her”,\nakar is the stem (ekarri = “bring”),\nd stands for “it” (absolutive argument is the direct object of transitive verbs),\nki stands for the dative case,\no stands for “he” and\ngu stands for “we” (ergative argument is the subject of transitive verbs).\n\n* Number[abs] is the number of the absolutive argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called absnumber.\n* Number[erg] is the number of the ergative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called ergnumber.\n* Number[dat] is the number of the dative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called datnumber.\n\nOne may want to use just Number instead of Number[abs].\nHowever, there are two issues with that (at least in Basque).\nFirst, the absolutive argument is not always the subject. For transitive verbs, it is the object, so the parallelism with nominative-accusative languages would be weak anyway.\nSecond, and more important, some Basque finite verbs have additional morphemes of nominal inflection.\nThus their form reflects the person-number agreement with the absolutive argument (nor), and nominal inflection (case, number etc.) at the same time.\nExamples: dena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Sing),\ndituena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Plur|Number[erg]=Sing),\ndugunak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Sing|Number[erg]=Plur),\ndirenak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Plur).\nSo we reserve the Number feature for nominal inflection, and the Number[abs] feature for agreement.\n\nNote that we also define Person[abs] and Polite[abs], although there is no direct conflict for these features.\nBut it is better to have these features aligned with Person[erg], Polite[erg], Person[dat] and Polite[dat]."

(This usage of the feature is typical for languages\nthat do not have case morphology on nouns. For languages that have both\nadpositions and morphological case, the traditional set of cases is\ndetermined by the nominal forms and it does not cover adpositional\nmeanings.) In some non-UD tagsets, case of adpositions is\nused as a valency feature (saying that the adposition requires its\nnominal argument to be in that morphological case); however, annotating\nadposition valency case in UD treebanks would be superfluous because the\nsame case feature can be found at the nominal to which the adposition\nbelongs.\n\nCase helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence,\nespecially in free-word-order languages. For example, the nominative\nand accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,\nwhile in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be\ndistinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.\n\nHere on the level of morphosyntactic features we are dealing with case\nexpressed morphologically, i.e. by bound morphemes (affixes). Note\nthat on a higher level case can be understood more broadly as _the\nrole,_ and it can be also expressed by adding an adposition to the\nnoun. What is expressed by affixes in one language can be expressed\nusing adpositions in another language. Cf. the u-dep/case\ndependency label.\n\nExamples\n\n* [cs] nominative matka \"mother\", genitive matky, dative matce,\n  accusative matku, vocative matko, locative matce,\n   instrumental matkou\n* [de] nominative der Mann \"the man\", genitive des Mannes,\n  dative dem Mann, accusative den Mann\n* [en] nominative/direct case he, she,\n  accusative/oblique case him, her.\n\nThe descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic\nhints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that\nquite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally\nunrelated to the meaning mentioned here.  Valency of verbs,\nadpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must\nbe in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot\n(semantic role). It is much the same as trying to explain the meaning\nof prepositions: most people would agree that the central meaning of\nEnglish in is location in space or time but there are phrases where\nthe meaning is less locational: In God we trust. _Say it in\nEnglish._\n\nNote that Indian corpora based on the so-called Paninian model use a\nrelated feature called vibhakti.  It is a merger of the Case feature\ndescribed here and of various postpositions. Values of the feature are\nlanguage-dependent because they are copies of the relevant morphemes\n(either bound morphemes or postpositions). Vibhakti can be mapped on\nthe Case values described here if we know 1. which source values are\nbound morphemes (postpositions are separate nodes for us) and 2. what\nis their meaning. For instance, the genitive case (Gen) in Bengali\nis marked using the suffix -ra (-র), i.e. vib=era.  In Hindi, the\nsuffix has been split off the noun and it is now written as a separate\nword &ndash; the postposition kā/kī/ke (का/की/के).  Even if the\npostpositional phrase can be understood as a genitive noun phrase, the\nnoun is not in genitive. Instead, the postposition requires that it\ntakes one of three case forms that are marked directly on the noun:\nthe oblique case (Acc)."

The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called absnumber.\n* Number[erg] is the number of the ergative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called ergnumber.\n* Number[dat] is the number of the dative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called datnumber.\n\nOne may want to use just Number instead of Number[abs].\nHowever, there are two issues with that (at least in Basque).\nFirst, the absolutive argument is not always the subject. For transitive verbs, it is the object, so the parallelism with nominative-accusative languages would be weak anyway.\nSecond, and more important, some Basque finite verbs have additional morphemes of nominal inflection.\nThus their form reflects the person-number agreement with the absolutive argument (nor), and nominal inflection (case, number etc.) at the same time.\nExamples: dena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Sing),\ndituena (Number=Sing|Number[abs]=Plur|Number[erg]=Sing),\ndugunak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Sing|Number[erg]=Plur),\ndirenak (Number=Plur|Number[abs]=Plur).\nSo we reserve the Number feature for nominal inflection, and the Number[abs] feature for agreement.\n\nNote that we also define Person[abs] and Polite[abs], although there is no direct conflict for these features.\nBut it is better to have these features aligned with Person[erg], Polite[erg], Person[dat] and Polite[dat]."

In general,\nthe feature is called gender if the number of possible values is relatively low\n(typically 2-4) and the partition correlates with sex of people and animals.\nIn language families where the number of categories is high (10-20), the feature\nis usually called noun class. No language family uses both the features.\n\nIn Bantu languages, the noun class also encodes Number; therefore it is\na lexical-inflectional feature of nouns.

    "content": "Gender[erg]\n\nFinite verbs in many Indo-European languages agree in person and number with their subject.\nSome languages in other families are head-marking, which means that the verbal morphology can cross-reference\nmultiple core arguments.\n\nIn Basque (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypersonal_agreement\">polypersonal language</a>),\ncertain verbs overtly mark agreement with up to three arguments:\none in the absolutive case,\none in ergative and\none in dative.\nThus in dakarkiogu “we bring it to him/her”,\nakar is the stem (ekarri = “bring”),\nd stands for “it” (absolutive argument is the direct object of transitive verbs),\nki stands for the dative case,\no stands for “he” and\ngu stands for “we” (ergative argument is the subject of transitive verbs).\n\nIn the informal register, there are also separate forms for masculine and feminine arguments,\nalthough gender is otherwise not distinguished in Basque.\n\n* Gender[erg] is the gender of the ergative argument of the verb.\n* Gender[dat] is the gender of the dative argument of the verb."
