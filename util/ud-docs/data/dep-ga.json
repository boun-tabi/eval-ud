By discrete we mean a compound noun often has a different, or more specific meaning than the individual components combined. \n\nExamples\n\nWe currently define noun compounds as including compounding noun constructions. The absence of a definite article in certain noun-noun constructions may indicate whether a noun-noun construction is compound: where the noun dependent is indefinite, the construction is often compound, while the same construction with a definite noun dependent is often labelled as nmod.

Office of_the Post)\n\nag cosaint na n-oifigí poist tuaithe \\n at protecting the offices post country\ncompound(n-oifigí, poist)\n\nAnother indication that the construction might be a compound noun is if the combination of both nouns together gives a meaning that is different in some way to the individual meaning of both words\nMac tíre (lit. ‘son of the land’) ‘wolf’\n\nmic léinn `students'   (lit. sons of_learning)\n\nbeidh an lámh in uachtar acu feasta ar mhic léinn \\n willbe the hand in upper atthem fromnowon on sons of_learning\ncompound(mhic, léinn)\n\nIf a noun-noun construction contains a cranberry word that does not occur outside of that specific construction, that is a strong indicator that the construction should be labelled as compound, i.e. Cúig déag (lit. ‘five teen’) ‘fifteen’.

Note that in the analysis of these examples, we treat the postposed subject or clausal argument as a regular core argument, and mark the expletive with expl.\n\nThere is a ghost in the room\nexpl(is, There)\nnsubj(is, ghost)\nobl(is, room)\n\nI believe there to be a ghost in the room\nnsubj(believe, I)\nexpl(believe, there)\nxcomp(believe, be)\nnsubj(be, ghost)\nobl(be, room)\n\nIt is clear that we should decline .\nexpl(clear, It)\ncsubj(clear, decline)\n\nThat we should decline is clear .\ncsubj(clear, decline)\n\nI mentioned it to Mary that Sue is leaving\nnsubj(mentioned, I)\nexpl(mentioned, it)\nobl(mentioned, Mary)\nccomp(mentioned, leaving)\n\nA second, related, use of the expl relation is for cases of true clitic doubling.  For languages in which clitics and lexical nominals are usually in complementary distribution – languages, such as French, which obey \"Kayne's generalization\" – then whichever of a clitic or a lexical nominal occurs will get the appropriate role, such as obj or iobj. In such languages, when doubling does occur, such as in spoken French, the right analysis is to regard the lexical nominal as dislocated (see the examples there). As such, the analysis will be the same as when a noun phrase doubles another noun phrase or a regular pronoun that fills a nominal argument position. However, other languages, such as Greek and Bulgarian, standardly allow doubling of a lexical nominal and a pronominal clitic, with the former still appearing in its regular role as an argument of the predicate. In these cases, if only one of the lexical nominal and the clitic appear in a clause, then whichever appears will be given the grammatical role of obj, iobj, etc. – parallel to the treatment of lexical nominals and pronouns in other languages, modulo the clitic pronoun having a different position in the sentence.  However, if both occur, the lexical nominal will be given the grammatical role of obj, iobj, etc., and the clitic will be treated as a pronominal copy, which does not receive its own semantic role, and hence will get the role expl. Modulo the different word order, this is fairly parallel to the treatment of it and there in English mentioned above, where another phrase satisfies the semantic role of the predicate. Examples from Greek and Bulgarian follow:\n\nΤης τον έδωσε της Καίτης τον αναπτήρα \\n PRON.Fem.Gen PRON.Masc.Acc gave ART.Fem.Gen Keti.Gen ART.Masc.Acc lighter.Acc\nexpl(έδωσε, Της-1)\niobj(έδωσε, Καίτης)\ndet(Καίτης, της-4)\nexpl(έδωσε, τον-2)\nobj(έδωσε, αναπτήρα)\ndet(αναπτήρα, τον-6)\n\nMarija mu izprati pismo na rabotnika \\n Maria 3.S.M.IO sent letter to the.worker\nexpl(izprati, mu)\nobj(izprati, pismo)\niobj(izprati, rabotnika)\ncase(rabotnika, na)\n\nReflexives\n\nThe expletive relation is also used for reflexive pronouns (see the feature u-feat/Reflex)\nattached to inherently reflexive verbs, i.e. verbs that cannot occur without the reflexive\npronoun and thus the pronoun does not play the role of a normal object\n(otherwise it would be possible to substitute it with an irreflexive pronoun or other nominal).\n\nUD recognizes several functions of reflexive pronouns (clitics) that are usually distinguished with the help of subtypes\nof the expl relation (see also the report from the 2015 Uppsala discussion of clitics where\nthis approach was approved):\n\n* expl:pv for reflexive clitics attached to inherently reflexive verbs (also called pronominal verbs in some grammars)\n* expl:pass for reflexive clitics attached to transitive verbs and acting as a voice marker (passive or mediopassive)\n* expl:impers for impersonal usage (works also with intransitive verbs)\n\nA Czech example:\n\nMartin se bojí zvířat . \\n Martin REFLEX fears animals .\nexpl:pv(bojí, se)\nexpl:pv(fears, REFLEX)\n\nFurther general discussion of expletives can be found in Postal, P. M., and G. K. Pullum (1988) “Expletive Noun Phrases in Subcategorized Positions,” Linguistic Inquiry 19(4): 635–670. The status of clitic doubling, and arguments for the lexical nominal being an argument with the clitic a kind of pronominal copy, appear inter alia in Boris Harizanov (2014) Clitic doubling at the syntax-morphology interface: A-movement and morphological merger in Bulgarian.

    "shortdef": "indirect object",
    "content": "| | WARNING |\n|-----------|--------|\n| ⚠️ | The traditional term \"indirect object\", associated with morphosyntactic encoding of certain types of arguments (especially datives/recipients) in a clause, has a wide range of interpretations across languages and linguistic frameworks. In UD, universal-level relations do not distinguish arguments and adjuncts; rather, the distinction is between core arguments and oblique modifiers. iobj must only be used for core arguments, never for obliques, as described below. The naming of this relation may be changed in the next major revision of the UD guidelines. |\n\nIn UD, the indirect object of a verb is any nominal phrase that is a core\nargument of the verb but is not its subject or (direct) object.\nThe prototypical example is the recipient of ditransitive verbs of\nexchange:\n\nShe gave me a raise\niobj(gave, me)\nnsubj(gave, She)\n\nHowever, many languages allow other semantic roles as additional objects. The most common case is allowing benefactives, but some languages allow other roles. Examples include instruments, such as in the Kinyarwanda example below, or comitatives. At the other extreme, some languages lack all indirect objects.\n\nUmukoóbwa a-ra-andik-iish-a íbárúwa íkárámu \\n girl 1-PRS-write-APPL-ASP letter pen\nobj(a-ra-andik-iish-a, íbárúwa)\niobj(a-ra-andik-iish-a, íkárámu)\n\nIn languages distinguishing morphological cases, the recipient will often be marked by the dative case.\nHowever, the iobj relation can be used only for a core argument. The morphological dative may signal a core argument\nin some languages (such as Basque) but in many others it is just oblique (like the English preposition to). For\ninstance, in many Indo-European languages, the recipient should be attached as obl and not iobj, regardless\nof the traditional grammar which may label it as “indirect object”.\n\nIn the following Czech example, the verb takes two objects. Both are nouns in the accusative case, which is rather\nunusual—for most other verbs, one of the arguments would be in the dative and would thus be treated as oblique in UD.\nHowever, a bare accusative signals a core object and a verb with one nominative and two accusatives is ditransitive\nin UD. One of the accusatives is direct object (patient), the other is indirect (recipient). It is parallel to how\nthe English translation would be annotated (where there is no morphological case marking) and also to verbs of giving\nin English (consider a similar sentence, he gave my daughter a class of maths).\n\nOn učí mou dceru matematiku . \\n He teaches my daughter.Acc maths.Acc .\nobj(učí, matematiku)\niobj(učí, dceru)\nobj(teaches, maths.Acc)\niobj(teaches, daughter.Acc)\n\nPredicates in Basque can cross-reference (by morphological agreement on the auxiliary verb) up to three arguments\nin different morphological cases: ergative, absolutive, and dative. The morphological cross-reference is a strong\nindicator that all three are core arguments. Therefore, if all three are present, we have a double-object situation\nand the dative argument will be iobj (while the ergative argument will be nsubj and the absolutive obj).\nEven if the absolutive argument is omitted for a verb which licenses three arguments, the dative argument is still\niobj.\n\n(Nik)/Case=Erg (zuri)/Case=Dat liburua/Case=Abs eman dizut . \\n (I) (you) book given I-have-you-it .\nnsubj(eman, (Nik))\niobj(eman, (zuri))\nobj(eman, liburua)\naux(eman, dizut)\npunct(eman, .-6)\nnsubj(given, (I))\niobj(given, (you))\nobj(given, book)\naux(given, I-have-you-it)\npunct(given, .-13)\n\nMariari/Case=Dat eman nion liburua/Case=Abs . \\n To-Maria given I-have-her-it book .\niobj(eman, Mariari)\nobj(eman, liburua)\naux(eman, nion)\npunct(eman, .-5)\niobj(given, To-Maria)\nobj(given, book)\naux(given, I-have-her-it)\npunct(given, .-11)\n\nMariari/Case=Dat eman nion . \\n To-Maria given I-have-her-it .\niobj(eman, Mariari)\naux(eman, nion)\npunct(eman, .-4)\niobj(given, To-Maria)\naux(given, I-have-her-it)\npunct(given, .-9)\n\nLiburua/Case=Abs eman nion . \\n Book given I-have-her-it .\nobj(eman, Liburua)\naux(eman, nion)\npunct(eman, .-4)\nobj(given, Book)\naux(given, I-have-her-it)\npunct(given, .-9)\n\nNevertheless, Basque has also a class of verbs that license only two core arguments, one ergative and\none dative. Here the ergative has the A function and the dative the P function (Zúñiga and Fernández 2014),\nmeaning that the dative is obj rather than iobj, as in “The teacher has looked angrily at the students.”\n\nIrakasleak/Case=Erg haserre begiratu die ikasleei/Case=Dat . \\n Teacher angrily looked he-has-them to-students .\nnsubj(begiratu, Irakasleak)\nadvmod(begiratu, haserre)\naux(begiratu, die)\nobj(begiratu, ikasleei)\npunct(begiratu, .-6)\nnsubj(looked, Teacher)\nadvmod(looked, angrily)\naux(looked, he-has-them)\nobj(looked, to-students)\npunct(looked, .-13)\n\nAnother class of transitive verbs in Basque license one dative and one absolutive argument. Here the\ndative has the A function and the absolutive the P function, meaning that the dative is nsubj and\nthe absolutive is obj, as in “The boy likes the soup very much.”\n\nZopa/Case=Abs izugarri gustatzen zaio mutilari/Case=Dat . \\n Soup greatly pleasing it-is-him to-boy .\nobj(gustatzen, Zopa)\nadvmod(gustatzen, izugarri)\naux(gustatzen, zaio)\nnsubj(gustatzen, mutilari)\npunct(gustatzen, .-6)\nobj(pleasing, Soup)\nadvmod(pleasing, greatly)\naux(pleasing, it-is-him)\nnsubj(pleasing, to-boy)\npunct(pleasing, .-13)\n\nIn Tagalog, core arguments are marked by the prepositions ang and ng (or by corresponding inflection\nof personal pronouns), while oblique dependents are typically marked by the preposition sa (sometimes\nglossed as the dative).

With a verb of giving, the theme is typically inanimate while the recipient is\ntypically animate. Assuming that nsubj and obj are reserved for the two core arguments\ncross-referenced by the verb, the theme has to be iobj (if it is a core argument at all; otherwise\nit would have to be obl; but real oblique nominals in Plains Cree take a locative case affix,\nwhich is not present here).\n\n* Nikī-miyāw anima masinahikan. “I gave him that book.”\n\n~~~ conllu\ntext = Nikī-miyāw anima masinahikan.\ntext_en = I gave him/her that book.\n1\tNikī-miyāw\tmiy\tVERB\t\tAnimacy=Anim|Mood=Ind|Number[high]=Sing|Number[low]=Sing|Person[high]=1|Person[low]=3|Tense=Past|Voice=Dir\t0\troot\t\tGloss=I-gave-him/her|MSeg=ni-kī-miy-ā-w|MGloss=1-PAST-give.to-DIR-3SG\n2\tanima\tanima\tDET\t\tAnimacy=Inan|Number=Sing|PronType=Dem\t3\tdet\t\tGloss=that|MGloss=DEM.0's\n3\tmasinahikan\tmasinahikan\tNOUN\t\tAnimacy=Inan|Number=Sing\t1\tiobj\t\tGloss=book|SpaceAfter=No\n4\t.\t.\tPUNCT\t\t\t1\tpunct\t_\tGloss=.\n\n~~~\n\nIn the above example, the verb stem used is for animate objects, while\nmasinahikan “book” is inanimate. That is a proof that the 3rd person singular\ncross-reference on the verb does not refer to the book but to an animate\nrecipient that is not overtly represented in the sentence.\n\nIf the language has a prototypical iobj (occurring in a double object construction with obj),\nthen morphosyntactic criteria need to be established for when a sole object is obj and when it is iobj.[^1]\nDepending on the language, potential reasons to consider a sole object in a clause as an iobj include:\n- It has case marking distinct from that of a prototypical obj, e.g. dative rather than accusative\n- Another, more patient-like object may be inserted into the clause without affecting the morphosyntax of the object in question\n- The verb licenses the object in combination with a ccomp (the ccomp may be analyzed as taking the place of an obj)\n\nFor example, in English, the verb teach may occur with obj, iobj, or both:\n\nShe teaches the students introductory logic .\niobj(teaches, students)\nobj(teaches, logic)\n\nShe teaches introductory logic .\nobj(teaches, logic)\n\nShe teaches the first-year students .\niobj(teaches, students)\n\nShe teaches her students that good writing is important .\niobj(teaches, students)\nccomp(teaches, important)\n\nShe teaches her students to write well .\niobj(teaches, students)\nxcomp(teaches, write)\n\nHowever, not all verbs license two objects (or an object plus ccomp), in which case the sole object should be plain obj even if it has recipient-like semantics:\n\nShe questions her students about their interests .\nobj(questions, students)\nobl(questions, interests)\n\nShe helps her students to succeed .\nobj(helps, students)\nxcomp(helps, succeed)\n\n^1]: This is an amended policy as described [on the changes page.\n\nReferences\n\n* Fernando Zúñiga, Beatriz Fernández (draft 26.6.2014): Grammatical relations in Basque\n* Arok Elessar Wolvengrey (2011):\n  Semantic and pragmatic functions in Plains Cree syntax\n  (PhD thesis).

  "clf": {
    "shortdef": "classifier",
    "content": "A clf (classifier) is a word which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts.\nThe most canonical use is numeral classifiers, where the word is used with a number for counting objects.\nA classifier generally reflects some kind of\nconceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents.\nEtymologically, classifiers are normally historically nouns, and the words may still also be used as independent nouns,\nbut in their classifier use they have scant semantics left.\nIn most cases, the most appropriate UPOS to give classifiers will still be NOUN, though you may wish to give the words a feature\nindicating their special status as a classifier. (There is at present no Universal feature for classifiers, but NounType=Clf\nmight be apt.)\nThe clf function is intended for languages which have highly grammaticalized systems of classifiers.\nThe greatest density of such languages is in Asia.\nAs well as core classifiers, there are often also other words, sometimes called \"massifiers\" that are used in counting with\nsimilar behavior to classifiers. These typically include words for containers (\"cup\", \"box\") and units (\"month\", \"inch\"),\nsuch as Chinese 袋 ‘bag’ in 一袋米 [one bag rice] ‘a bag of rice’.\nIn a classifier language, it is usually most appropriate to also analyze these words as classifiers.\nMost other languages also count things with units, however, for these languages, such as English, clf is not used and rather\nstandard noun phrase relations are still used (despite there also being incipient grammaticalization in many cases, including English).\nSee the examples for English at the end.\n\nHere are some examples from Mandarin/Putonghua Chinese:\n\n* 三个学生 (三個學生) sān gè xuéshēng = “three students”, literally “three [human-classifier] student”\n* 三棵树 (三棵樹) sān kē shù = “three trees”, literally “three [tree-classifier] tree”\n* 三只鸟 (三隻鳥) sān zhī niǎo = “three birds”, literally “three [bird-classifier] bird”\n* 三条河 (三條河) sān tiáo hé = “three rivers”, literally “three [long-wavy-classifier] river”\n\nSyntactically, the classifier groups with the numeral rather than the noun and we therefore treat\nclassifiers as functional dependents of numerals (or possessives) using the new clf relation. (This\nis one of Greenberg’s universals and is true in almost all cases.\nA couple of exceptions are noted in Aikhenvald (2000: 105) Classifiers, OUP, but it is noticeable that in those languages\nthe putative head noun is in the genitive case.)\n\n<div class=\"sd-parse\">\nsān gè xuéshēng \\n three clf student\nnummod(xuéshēng, sān)\nclf(sān, gè)\n</div>\n\nSometimes a classifier is inserted between a demonstrative and a noun (instead of numeral and noun) [zh]:\n\n乘坐 這 輛 巴士 \\n Chéngzuò zhè liàng bāshì \\n Take this CLF bus\nobj(乘坐, 巴士)\ndet(巴士, 這)\nclf(這, 輛)\nobj(Chéngzuò, bāshì)\ndet(bāshì, zhè)\nclf(zhè, liàng)\nobj(Take, bus)\ndet(bus, this)\nclf(this, CLF)\n\nClassifier words also occur in various other constructions, and so it is important to distinguish the word in a particular\nlanguage from the universal classifier function proposed in UD. We go through here some further examples with Chinese classifiers.\n\nNo noun may appear with the number and classifier.\nIn this case, the classifier takes the role of the missing noun, and we promote the classifier to be the head.\nSo 我 買 兩 本 “I am buying two” is regarded as “I am buying two [books-CLF]”.\n\n我 買 兩 本 \\n I buy two CLF\nobj(買, 本)\nnummod(本, 兩)\n\nIn some languages, including Chinese, a classifier can also appear without a number, and frequently then has some sort of\ndeterminative function. We use the relation det for such uses of a classifier. For instance, in Cantonese ‘She bought a/the book’:\n\n佢 買 咗 本 書 \\n keoi maai zo bun syu \\n 3sg buy PERF CLF book\nobj(買, 書)\ndet(書, 本)\n\nFor languages without highly grammaticalized classifier systems, standard nominal modification relationships are used\neven when things are being counted in groups (with \"massifiers\"). For example, in English:\n\nthree cups of rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\ncase(oats, of)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)\n\nthree cups rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)"
