  "clf": {
    "shortdef": "classifier",
    "content": "A clf (classifier) is a word which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts.\nThe most canonical use is numeral classifiers, where the word is used with a number for counting objects.\nA classifier generally reflects some kind of\nconceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents.\nEtymologically, classifiers are normally historically nouns, and the words may still also be used as independent nouns,\nbut in their classifier use they have scant semantics left.\nIn most cases, the most appropriate UPOS to give classifiers will still be NOUN, though you may wish to give the words a feature\nindicating their special status as a classifier. (There is at present no Universal feature for classifiers, but NounType=Clf\nmight be apt.)\nThe clf function is intended for languages which have highly grammaticalized systems of classifiers.\nThe greatest density of such languages is in Asia.\nAs well as core classifiers, there are often also other words, sometimes called \"massifiers\" that are used in counting with\nsimilar behavior to classifiers. These typically include words for containers (\"cup\", \"box\") and units (\"month\", \"inch\"),\nsuch as Chinese 袋 ‘bag’ in 一袋米 [one bag rice] ‘a bag of rice’.\nIn a classifier language, it is usually most appropriate to also analyze these words as classifiers.\nMost other languages also count things with units, however, for these languages, such as English, clf is not used and rather\nstandard noun phrase relations are still used (despite there also being incipient grammaticalization in many cases, including English).\nSee the examples for English at the end.\n\nHere are some examples from Mandarin/Putonghua Chinese:\n\n* 三个学生 (三個學生) sān gè xuéshēng = “three students”, literally “three [human-classifier] student”\n* 三棵树 (三棵樹) sān kē shù = “three trees”, literally “three [tree-classifier] tree”\n* 三只鸟 (三隻鳥) sān zhī niǎo = “three birds”, literally “three [bird-classifier] bird”\n* 三条河 (三條河) sān tiáo hé = “three rivers”, literally “three [long-wavy-classifier] river”\n\nSyntactically, the classifier groups with the numeral rather than the noun and we therefore treat\nclassifiers as functional dependents of numerals (or possessives) using the new clf relation. (This\nis one of Greenberg’s universals and is true in almost all cases.\nA couple of exceptions are noted in Aikhenvald (2000: 105) Classifiers, OUP, but it is noticeable that in those languages\nthe putative head noun is in the genitive case.)\n\n<div class=\"sd-parse\">\nsān gè xuéshēng \\n three clf student\nnummod(xuéshēng, sān)\nclf(sān, gè)\n</div>\n\nSometimes a classifier is inserted between a demonstrative and a noun (instead of numeral and noun) [zh]:\n\n乘坐 這 輛 巴士 \\n Chéngzuò zhè liàng bāshì \\n Take this CLF bus\nobj(乘坐, 巴士)\ndet(巴士, 這)\nclf(這, 輛)\nobj(Chéngzuò, bāshì)\ndet(bāshì, zhè)\nclf(zhè, liàng)\nobj(Take, bus)\ndet(bus, this)\nclf(this, CLF)\n\nClassifier words also occur in various other constructions, and so it is important to distinguish the word in a particular\nlanguage from the universal classifier function proposed in UD. We go through here some further examples with Chinese classifiers.\n\nNo noun may appear with the number and classifier.\nIn this case, the classifier takes the role of the missing noun, and we promote the classifier to be the head.\nSo 我 買 兩 本 “I am buying two” is regarded as “I am buying two [books-CLF]”.\n\n我 買 兩 本 \\n I buy two CLF\nobj(買, 本)\nnummod(本, 兩)\n\nIn some languages, including Chinese, a classifier can also appear without a number, and frequently then has some sort of\ndeterminative function. We use the relation det for such uses of a classifier. For instance, in Cantonese ‘She bought a/the book’:\n\n佢 買 咗 本 書 \\n keoi maai zo bun syu \\n 3sg buy PERF CLF book\nobj(買, 書)\ndet(書, 本)\n\nFor languages without highly grammaticalized classifier systems, standard nominal modification relationships are used\neven when things are being counted in groups (with \"massifiers\"). For example, in English:\n\nthree cups of rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\ncase(oats, of)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)\n\nthree cups rolled oats\nnummod(cups, three)\namod(oats, rolled)\nnmod(cups, oats)"

    "content": "This relation captures expletive or pleonastic nominals. These are nominals that appear in an argument position of a predicate but which do not themselves satisfy any of the semantic roles of the predicate. The main predicate of the clause (the verb or predicate adjective or noun) is the governor. In English, this is the case for some uses of it and there: the existential there, and it when used in extraposition constructions.  (Note that both it and there also have non-expletive uses.)\n\nThere is a ghost in the room\nexpl(is, There)\n\nIt is clear that we should decline .\nexpl(clear, It)\n\nSome languages do not have expletives of the English sort, including most languages with free pro-drop (the ability to use zero anaphora rather than overt pronouns). In languages with expletives of this sort, they can be positioned where normally a core argument appears: the subject and direct object (and even indirect object) slots, as in the examples below. Note that in the analysis of these examples, we treat the postposed subject or clausal argument as a regular core argument, and mark the expletive with expl.\n\nThere is a ghost in the room\nexpl(is, There)\nnsubj(is, ghost)\nobl(is, room)\n\nI believe there to be a ghost in the room\nnsubj(believe, I)\nexpl(believe, there)\nxcomp(believe, be)\nnsubj(be, ghost)\nobl(be, room)\n\nIt is clear that we should decline .\nexpl(clear, It)\ncsubj(clear, decline)\n\nThat we should decline is clear .\ncsubj(clear, decline)\n\nI mentioned it to Mary that Sue is leaving\nnsubj(mentioned, I)\nexpl(mentioned, it)\nobl(mentioned, Mary)\nccomp(mentioned, leaving)\n\nA second, related, use of the expl relation is for cases of true clitic doubling.  For languages in which clitics and lexical nominals are usually in complementary distribution – languages, such as French, which obey \"Kayne's generalization\" – then whichever of a clitic or a lexical nominal occurs will get the appropriate role, such as obj or iobj. In such languages, when doubling does occur, such as in spoken French, the right analysis is to regard the lexical nominal as dislocated (see the examples there). As such, the analysis will be the same as when a noun phrase doubles another noun phrase or a regular pronoun that fills a nominal argument position. However, other languages, such as Greek and Bulgarian, standardly allow doubling of a lexical nominal and a pronominal clitic, with the former still appearing in its regular role as an argument of the predicate. In these cases, if only one of the lexical nominal and the clitic appear in a clause, then whichever appears will be given the grammatical role of obj, iobj, etc. – parallel to the treatment of lexical nominals and pronouns in other languages, modulo the clitic pronoun having a different position in the sentence.  However, if both occur, the lexical nominal will be given the grammatical role of obj, iobj, etc., and the clitic will be treated as a pronominal copy, which does not receive its own semantic role, and hence will get the role expl. Modulo the different word order, this is fairly parallel to the treatment of it and there in English mentioned above, where another phrase satisfies the semantic role of the predicate. Examples from Greek and Bulgarian follow:\n\nΤης τον έδωσε της Καίτης τον αναπτήρα \\n PRON.Fem.Gen PRON.Masc.Acc gave ART.Fem.Gen Keti.Gen ART.Masc.Acc lighter.Acc\nexpl(έδωσε, Της-1)\niobj(έδωσε, Καίτης)\ndet(Καίτης, της-4)\nexpl(έδωσε, τον-2)\nobj(έδωσε, αναπτήρα)\ndet(αναπτήρα, τον-6)\n\nMarija mu izprati pismo na rabotnika \\n Maria 3.S.M.IO sent letter to the.worker\nexpl(izprati, mu)\nobj(izprati, pismo)\niobj(izprati, rabotnika)\ncase(rabotnika, na)\n\nReflexives\n\nThe expletive relation is also used for reflexive pronouns (see the feature u-feat/Reflex)\nattached to inherently reflexive verbs, i.e. verbs that cannot occur without the reflexive\npronoun and thus the pronoun does not play the role of a normal object\n(otherwise it would be possible to substitute it with an irreflexive pronoun or other nominal).\n\nUD recognizes several functions of reflexive pronouns (clitics) that are usually distinguished with the help of subtypes\nof the expl relation (see also the report from the 2015 Uppsala discussion of clitics where\nthis approach was approved):\n\n* expl:pv for reflexive clitics attached to inherently reflexive verbs (also called pronominal verbs in some grammars)\n* expl:pass for reflexive clitics attached to transitive verbs and acting as a voice marker (passive or mediopassive)\n* expl:impers for impersonal usage (works also with intransitive verbs)\n\nA Czech example:\n\nMartin se bojí zvířat . \\n Martin REFLEX fears animals .\nexpl:pv(bojí, se)\nexpl:pv(fears, REFLEX)\n\nFurther general discussion of expletives can be found in Postal, P. M., and G. K. Pullum (1988) “Expletive Noun Phrases in Subcategorized Positions,” Linguistic Inquiry 19(4): 635–670. The status of clitic doubling, and arguments for the lexical nominal being an argument with the clitic a kind of pronominal copy, appear inter alia in Boris Harizanov (2014) Clitic doubling at the syntax-morphology interface: A-movement and morphological merger in Bulgarian.

Their coding (preposition and\nmorphological case) is determined by the predicate; within the set of\narguments of this predicate, the coding maps the argument to a particular\nsemantic role.\nIn contrast, the semantics of an adjunct is relatively independent of the\npredicate, and typical adjuncts (such as specifications of time, location,\nmanner or instrument) can combine with a large number of different predicates.\n\nHence in the above example, the preposition na “on” and the accusative case of\nthe noun instinkt “instinct” are selected by the verb spoléhat “to rely”.\nOther verbs may also select the same preposition and case but the meaning will\nbe different: for instance, myslet na někoho “to think of someone.”\nFinally, the preposition na itself has an adessive or allative meaning\n(see the corresponding values of the Case feature).\nThis meaning is suppressed when the preposition is selected by a predicate but\nit is more recognizable in adjuncts.
