    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

However, when training a transfer model over multiple sources, not every source is equally useful for the target. To better transfer a model, it is essential to understand the values of the sources. In this paper, we develop , an efficient source valuation framework for quantifying the usefulness of the sources (e.g., ) in transfer learning based on the Shapley value method. Experiments and comprehensive analyses on both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfers demonstrate that our framework is not only effective in choosing useful transfer sources but also the source values match the intuitive source-target similarity.",

Recent work shows that semantic parsing can be accomplished by transforming syntactic dependencies to logical forms. However, this work is limited to English, and cannot process dependency graphs, which allow handling complex phenomena such as control. In this work, we introduce UDepLambda, a semantic interface for UD, which maps natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent fashion and can process dependency graphs. We perform experiments on question answering against Freebase and provide German and Spanish translations of the WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets to facilitate multilingual evaluation. Results show that UDepLambda outperforms strong baselines across languages and datasets. For English, it achieves a 4.9 F1 point improvement over the state-of-the-art on GraphQuestions.",

The annotation of dependency parsing is done using different formalisms at word-level namely Universal Dependencies and chunk-level namely AnnaCorra. Though dependency parsing is deeply dealt in languages such as English, Czech etc the same cannot be adopted for the morphologically rich and agglutinative languages. In this paper, we discuss the development of a dependency parser for Tamil, a South Dravidian language. The different characteristics of the language make this task a challenging task. Tamil, a morphologically rich and agglutinative language, has copula drop, accusative and genitive case drop and pro-drop. Coordinative constructions are introduced by affixation of morpheme {`}um{'}. Embedded clausal structures are common in relative participle and complementizer clauses. In this paper, we have discussed our approach to handle some of these challenges. We have used Malt parser, a supervised learning- approach based implementation. We have obtained an accuracy of 79.27{\%} for Unlabelled Attachment Score, 73.64{\%} for Labelled Attachment Score and 68.82{\%} for Labelled Accuracy.",
